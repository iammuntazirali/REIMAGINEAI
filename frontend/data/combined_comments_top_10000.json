The notion that China just suddenly became capitalist is pervasive and misguided.\n\nThat's called state capitalism with a centralised planning system not socialism. \n\n&gt;Socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production\n\nNo, the workers own it, not the state. What usually happens is that the state assumes control over the means of production via authoritarianism. \n\n&gt;The Chinese government and communist party directly run the economy \n\nCCP is about as Communist as the Democrat People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is Democratic. \n\n&gt;China is actually less socialist than Nordic model countries in the realm of wealth redistribution and tax rates.\n\nSocial democratic societies such as the Nordic Model operate under a capitalist framework. They just have generous welfare nets. \n\n&gt;Perhaps you can't actually call China socialist, perhaps they're something new and unique.\n\nNot even Chinese people consider their government socialist. Words have meanings. \n\nEven under a \"state owned system\", the wealth needs to be redistributed and funneled into public welfare systems. The state should also not profit off of the enterprises and industries they own. \n\nTo put it simply, you are incorrect in your assessment. China is a ruthless, authoritarian capitalist society that will break any rules needed to get ahead.

Nor am I asking for the NK to not be a villain. I just hoped his plot would be resolved in a less one-dimensional fashion.\n\nThe \"kill the head and the body dies\" trope is incredibly tired and boring. They couldn't really do anything about that because of how they wrote the episode, but whatever.\n\nThe \"the villain goes to kill the hero himself, leaving himself vulnerable to attack\" trope is incredibly tired, boring, and makes no sense given the NK has no characterization.\n\nThe latter -- the NK having little to no character -- is source of one of my major gripes: killing the NK doesn't feel meaningful. He's not an interesting character. He is literally a one-dimensional character whose only goal is to murder humanity, for reasons that are really not themselves that interesting.\nUh...  \n\nMine is   \n\n    ¬Ø\\\\__(„ÉÑ)__/¬Ø     \n\n\nYou need an extra \"\\\" in there before the first arm.

Reddit as a company is much more hands on in good and bad ways. Companies use bought accounts and astroturf the front page. I think the difference now is that reddit is much more mainstream.

Was this something GRRM told them to do? Is it where GRRM plans on taking the story? We don't know but but based on Inside the Episode it seems like the writer's decided it should be Arya because 'it was surprising and hopefully people wouldn't see it coming.'  In order to help this work they retconned the Mel quote and built two seasons alluding to Arya being the one to kill NK.  People are angry because 1.

Her purpose was carried out, she took her amulet off and her very old body gave up, that could‚Äôve been slightly more epic but whatever. I understand that our lead cast can‚Äôt die unceremoniously, but soldiers die with no pomp or circumstance all the time. \n   There were things done right, and things done wrong. The music and cinematography were completely on point, it was the storyline that I disliked, especially the whole Walking Dead in the library experience Arya had....very cheap. \n    And I‚Äôm expecting shit for this, but halfway through this season already and I am not liking what I‚Äôve seen thus far.

The NBA and video games seem to have the same general audience already, why not further blur those lines? \n\nGetting back to back blocks on the same player in the same possession gives your team a red shell and automatically forces the opposing coach to sub out that player in shame at the next dead ball and keep them on the bench for at least five minutes of game time. \n\nMaybe add rewards for consecutive made shots of the same type being worth more or less. Hit three \"three's\" in a row and unlock a holographic power star. Power stars grant you +1 points per made shot, +0.5 points per assisted shot, and immunity from foul calls for 30 seconds. \n\nLastly golden mushrooms, players that get a golden mushroom have to take it and play the next game.\nThanks for the interesting response, this sheds a bit more light on how it came about. \n\nI've been trying to understand what was actually going on during the cold war in SA, and how people in the US and abroad felt about it, as it's not something that's taught in US schools. \n\nFor example, was the coup against Arbenz in Guatamala viewed similarly? \n\nDo people believe Armas was better than Arbenz? I've heard people say this and all the other similar coups in SA were victories for freedom and democracy,  but in every case I've read (guatamala, hondurous, chile, nicaragua) the people who replaced the communist/socialists were far more repressive and anti-democratic than those they replaced. \n\nIn this modern case with Guaido it doesn't seem to be the case, but that's why I'm wondering if people also thought the same thing when supporting those other coups.\nSo it's not over yet??\nPut down is more like it.\n–ù–µ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º, –µ—Å—Ç—å –ª—é–¥–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–º –Ω–∞–¥–æ –Ω–∞–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å—é, –∑–∞–±–æ—Ç–æ–π, –≤–µ—Å–µ–ª—å–µ–º. –ò —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ç–æ–≥–¥–∞ –æ–Ω–∏ —Å–º–æ–≥—É—Ç –¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∏–º–∏ —Å–∞–º–∏. –ê —Ç–∞–∫ –¥–≤–∞ —É–Ω—ã–ª—ã—Ö –≥–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –±—É–¥—É—Ç —Å–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å.\nChild‚Äôs play better be good and not have too much fucking comedies like all the middle ones\nI just want to know why they stopped shooting flaming boulders once they saw the Dothraki were gone.\n[Here‚Äôs a guide on how to survive big storms](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yGadEjN8C7Q) hopefully it calms you down :)\nThats actually really cool.

Gun owners have called for, time and again, the NICS system to be opened to the public, even at a nominal fee, so that they can do their own background checks when selling their firearms.

I remember mourning them so vividly, screaming about how i had killed them to a friend who later suggested that I talk again to them because we were both just kids despite being aware of what they had put me through even prior to the event. Every time they returned again, I felt betrayed and conflicted because on one hand I was so, so happy they were alive but on the other I couldn't breathe knowing they had used the thing they had done to get together with me (I had to \"confess\" I loved them to stop them from killing themselves on a call one night because I was dating someone that wasn't them who I ended up dumping after we drifted apart - I really hope they're doing better these days) to hurt me so much. \n\nI've been to therapy, it's not the best but it's helping.

Yes, certain characters should have epic moments, stepping into the fantasy-legend role. However, I don't think that should nullify the rules we've been playing with since the beginning. Fighting off dozens of wights because you're a badass swordsman? Sure! Surviving as an overweight coward who fell multiple times, has next-to-zero battle training, and whimpered while being overwhelmed? Doesn't make sense. Being completely surrounded and backed into a wall without the space to even swing your sword, and then magically being ok the next scene? Doesn't make sense.

Now you're saying that is just tokenism.\n\n3) **You** said the republicans would never elect a black person as president, but there only has to be one black person who could be elected as president to prove that's not true; you're now saying \"one or two isn't proof of anything.\"\n\nThe truth is, the only way for me to prove that there is a black person that can be elected president by the republican party is for there to already have been a black person who has been elected president by the republican party.  Otherwise, you can always just say that person would never get elected.  Without Obama, you'd be in the exact same position with respect to the democrat party.  Obama was the most talented politician we've in decades -- had he been a republican, I think he would have been elected president as a republican.\n\nBut if you're going to just ignore my arguments and keep shifting the goal posts, there isn't really much I can offer you.\nTeaching the classes with smart people\nWomen don‚Äôt exist ya bot\nThe chicken is still thawing\nNo roast you know the rules\nDo doo do do do\nwombats are a cross between koalas and bears\nYta don't go against what the woman say they rule the house.

The whole point of a special counsel is to create distance from the President and justice department influence.\n\nBut you're correct that to the extent that Rosenstein had some control over aspects of it (like his judgment with Barr after mueller submitted the report) it would be improper for Trump to discuss any of the ins and outs of that decision or influence it in any way. I don't think that is implied by Rods letter though. \n\nIt still might have happened I don't know. I personally doubt it, but it's possible, and I'll grant that it's worth looking in to. Maybe Congress will ask him to testify about that.

Flying Pyramids\nThat's the conventional wisdom, but has it really been proven to work? The biggest criticisms I've heard about losing democratic tickets over the years was that they lacked clear message. Voters didn't have a strong sense of what the candidate(s) actually stood for. Certainly Clinton/Kaine suffered from a less clear definition of what they stood for compared to their competition (as ugly as what Trump stood for was, it was at least crystal clear).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really wonder if picking a VP that is ideologically similar, that can passionately articulate what their administration will represent, would be a better strategy than trying to spread the ticket's appeal with some other swing state Senator/Governor with a different ideology. A Warren/Sanders ticket would have an incredibly strong brand among Democrats and progressives.

I‚Äôm guessing the murderers only shot at them because they didn‚Äôt have any.\nThen stop reading the news.\nI don't even think that's the real explanation anymore. It's not that they ran out of book material. It's that the show has grown beyond the book audience and has reached mass appeal. The general audience, as you can clearly see even in this thread, doesn't care about narrative or well written stories or any of that shit. They just want the spectacle. They want to turn their brains off and cheer and clap when their favorite death ninja girl kills the big bad guy. The showrunners are simply appealing to the large part of their audience at the expense of good storytelling.\nSturridge was benched by Ryan fucking Bertrand that night\nMe before a night out refusing to go to the club unless all my friends compliment my new trainers\nThat would make a lot of sense, but I‚Äôve hung with him as friends and through clubs and stuff, and never noticed any food pickiness or issues, I guess it could be the budget, but he never mentioned anything else to do when I asked, so I‚Äôm not really sure... thanks for giving me a slightly different POV!\nBeing oblivious to the suffering and general condition of others. My dad worked for a low-key millionaire a couple years ago and he had no problem taking my dad away from his family and his other clients for weeks at a time.

Sean used to plug their sauce constantly, but I can't even remember the last time I've heard him do it. Also, the only staple here is Da Bomb, which is universally loathed.....so I think it just might be that Da Bomb is so bad and The Last Dab was specifically designed with the show in mind that it just be much more pleasurable in how the heat hits you. Anybody who enjoys heat knows some taste like flaming hot diesel fuel immediately, and some are even hotter but actually are tasty and creep up on you. It's basically the difference between really hot shit that tastes like ass you want no part of versus really hot food you just cant stop taking another bite of. I've purchased a \"level 5\" Hot Ones sauce in the past, and while I didn't care for the pineapple I really enjoyed the heat profile. I didn't put it on but a handful of dishes and didn't like the \"sweet heat\", in case you think I'm shilling, but a mustard based, read vinegary, hot sauce would be more up my alley.\nCan‚Äôt you just go along with the ‚ÄúPaul Pierce bad‚Äù bandwagon?\nWhen my friend said she has a separate cottage on her property.

Sometimes not even knowing is haunting.  \n\n\nMy grandmother had dementia. And my siblings as well as my parents were always around her and my grandfather to take care of them. We went away for a three week vacation and my dads sisters came around to watch my grandparents and take care of them. When we got back my grandmother's entire demeanor had changed. She went from loving us, talking to us daily and having full trust to out right hating us. She screamed at my older brother and our mother to get out of her house and never set foot in it again. We were accused of beating, stealing, coercing, and other crimes against my grandparents.  \nMy father's sisters used my grandmothers dementia to warp her mind into believing we were out to get her despite being there for her and my grandfather for years prior, trying to keep them going through their rapidly decreasing health. My grandparents were fairly wealthy and we knew my aunts were trying to get their money. We went to court twice with them to defend ourselves against the accusations. My aunts never won, but I still never saw my grandparents again. The damage was done.  \n\n\nMy grandmother passed about two years later and my grandfather followed after another two. I will never know if my grandmother, who practically raised me and my older brother while our parents worked their butts off, died hating us, loving us, or maybe not evening remembering. And I will never know if they died alone or had someone beside them. I think of both of them often and it still haunts me.  \n\n\nAnd in case anyone was wondering, my grandfather had suffered a massive stroke years before this all went down and as such wasn't always quite lucid, so while all this went down he didn't fully care is how I would imagine, or maybe didn't fully grasp the situation.\nSonya Deville.

He was one of those kids that acted like he had everything to offer but had nothing to really give. He was a huge troublemaker and did the absolute bare minimum in all his classes. \n\nBio was my first period, so it's the first place I'd go in the morning to put my stuff down before wandering around until the day started. This day though I had gotten shit sleep so I put my stuff down and lay my head on the desk to try and get some napping in before I had to be truly awake.\n\nCollen was also in the bio room, getting early morning tutoring from the teacher. The teacher was this nice little Asian lady who had only been teaching a couple of years at this point. She's going over a past test with him, and he's clearly not picking up on much of anything that she says, and so he's getting annoyed.\n\nEventually he's done with it. He slams the pencil down and say something like, \"fuck this crap\" and starts walking to the door. Before he can make it all the way out, my teacher yells for him, and he turns to face her. She just looks at him and goes \"You're a jackass. I don't know if you realize it, but I hear plenty of other kids talking about how annoying you are. If school was anything like survivor, you'd be first one voted off the island, and everyone would celebrate after.\" She said it so smoothly like she was thinking it up as she was tutoring him. Me and the other couple of kids in the room are just silent. All he could muster was a \"Cool.\" Before stepping out.\n\nThe bell rang and the rest of the class came in and nothing seemed to come of it all. Everything just continued like normal. I didn't have bio with Collen so I'm not sure if he behaved any differently in her class afterwards.\nYa hold up, wait a minute.

One of the guys in his group called him an elitist (he didn't seem to be great friends with most of his group), and I think that's probably accurate. He thought that he was hot shit, and the vast majority of people who tolerate that kind of attitude aren't exactly the best people themselves.\nIf this is a dank meme, **Upvote** this comment!\n\n\nIf this is not a dank meme, **Downvote** this comment!\n\n\nIf this post breaks the rules, **report** it and **Downvote** this comment!\n\n\n^Thank ^you ^for ^helping ^us ^in ^keeping ^/r/dankmemes ^dank.

You're very level headed and it helps your argument a lot! \n\nAs for my response to your points, I can see what you mean about the Blues with what you say up to this point:\n\n&gt;Can you honestly say that the Blues are worse than Senators or Oilers before the season ? Hell no.\n\nAnd I agree with everything you've said up until that point. You're right, starting the season on paper the Blues were supposed to actually be one of the more dominant teams in the NHL with their offseason acquisitions. But it was more than just the goaltending that had problems. At one point we had the lowest Goals For in the entire league which is obviously not a problem that bringing in a new goaltender solved. Coaching helped there which is why Berube also got the nomination for Jack Adams, but for nearly everything else Binnington has pretty much been the solution. Our defense looks a hell of a lot better than it did originally, but to be honest it still looks pretty weak and I'm seeing Binnington have to make 1 to 2 desperation saves nearly every game. \n\nBut what I'm trying to say is that no, before the season I wouldn't have said the Blues were going to be worse than the Senators or Oilers. But after watching 4 straight months of them prove that wrong, I was resigned to the fact that we were going to finish 31st in the league. I had 0 hope on Jan 1st that they'd ever turn it around. When they turned it around I was absolutely floored as a Blues fan. A team doesn't magically turn into a scoring powerhouse just because a goaltender starts heating up. And yet somehow, they did. Even when Berube first came on nothing seemed to change. It wasn't until Binnington's debut that they started dominating. I've never seen anything like it in my life as a hockey fan. \n\nAs for how Binnington is not nominated for Vezina, his competition is other goaltenders who have more games under their belt with equally incredible stats. I think that when you're comparing goalie to goalie you have to look at games played very objectively and can say \"well obviously Binner didn't come close to the GP that Vasi did and he still had incredible stats\". \n\nBut with Calder, my opinions on that are different. You shouldn't be able to compare goaltenders to skaters honestly. 32 games as a goalie is still a large chunk when you consider there are plenty of starters that only hit ~50. So when everyone says \"Binnington's played less than half the season\" that's technically true, but he's also played damn near the ENTIRE half of the season whereas plenty of other starters play ~15 games over half the season but they do it all season long. Add in the fact that no NHL goalie ever *starts* the first game of the season for a debut (goalies literally have to wait for 1 of 2 goalies to go down before they get a call up in nearly every case) whereas a skater can just get called up and poof you toss one of the other 12 forwards you've got down to the minors. \n\nLook I know he's not going to win it over Petey. But goalies aren't expected to get a call up at the start of the year so without taking candidates like this one seriously you'll never get Calder-winning goaltenders.\nIf I move, don‚Äôt move with me\nhe learned about it in infinity war, which is why he gave thanos the time stone to save stark's life so stark could sacrifice himself in endgame.\nNo and they never will.

It is also plausible that contested shots need more power, arc or something else compared to a wide open shots.

Otherwise, I don't think we have convincing evidence.\nThat took me a bit but get down girl, go ahead, get down\nThe rape party woman who accused Kavanaugh later recanted, and your side STILL accuses Kavanaugh of being a serial rapist.

Pretty happy to be wrong there.\nIs it a cooincidence that Rosenstein left the day before this hit?\nIt's rather difficult to name a communist state that *isn't* some form of tyranny.  That's the underlying problem with Marx.  He perfectly described Capitalism's faults, and then prescribed something that apparently is impossible to actually implement without descending into tyranny and mind control.  There's some fundamental miss in both Marx and Lenin that doesn't take into account some important  natural human factors issue, and that seems to cause communist states to be forced to resort to \"reprogramming\" people in various ways.\n\nSo, we err on the side of too much liberty so that we don't have to deal with the opposite problem, which is viewed as more intractable.\nThe answer is that it is really none of your business.

I agree the end of the AOTD was incredibly anticlimactic and I personally would‚Äôve preferred to see Dany as Azor Ahai, but like I‚Äôm so fucking ready to move on from this part of the story already. If the show didn‚Äôt gas the NK as much as they did, and Arya killed a basic WW then the outrage wouldn‚Äôt be so strong. The story isn‚Äôt supposed to be about good vs. evil anyway.

I feel like he knew what pieces needed to be in place in order to defeat the NK, and he clearly knew that going out to the Godswood would draw out the NK, and probably that Arya would need that dagger in the end. What‚Äôs more curious is what he was doing while he was ‚Äúgone‚Äù during the battle because I doubt he was just flying around in a crow the whole time.\nWell, we now have more info that Rosenstein sold out, that he protected criminality.

Even Steve Wilkes left leaving very high praises for Rosen. so that has been the best case for him I‚Äôve seen\n&gt;Helm's deep had a way bigger wall\n\nWider? Yes. Taller, not really. If you go back and look at pics, it's not as big as one would've imagined. The only tall part is the actual main castle's wall.\n\n&gt;wight must be killed or else it will keep attacking at full strength\n\nThis part actually confuses me. We can see very clearly in Jorah's final stand that a single slash to any part of the body kills them instantly. Need to go back and confirm, but I'm under the impression that a single slash or stab kills them, as does how White Walkers die (seen with both Valyrian steel and dragonglass).\n\n&gt;focused the enemy's attack to a relatively small surface area  \n&gt;  \n&gt;area of Winterfell that must be defended by an onslaught is much larger\n\nTrue, I'd agree with that. I guess we can even the playing fields by discussing from the point AFTER the walls have been breached (e.g. Elven archers prepared for shooting upon breach). But going back to the major point, Winterfell could've done a heck of a lot better job in coordination and strategy. Dragons were also utilized so poorly.

Additionally, this film fleshes out Tony's relationship with his father.\n\nFrom Thor 1 and Captain America 1 - the city where Odin fought the frost giants and where Red Skull found the tesseract is T√∏nsberg, the same city where New Asgard is placed in this movie. \n\nFrom Captain America 1 - \"I could do this all day\", and then Cap and Bucky's lines when they say goodbye to each other at the start of this film are the same as when they say goodbye at the end of Endgame except switched - Cap says what Bucky said before and Bucky says what Cap said before. \"Don't do anything stupid.\" \"you're taking all the stupid with you.\"\n\nFrom Captain America 2 - \"On your left\" &amp; the elevator scene\n\nAge of Ultron - the things that Tony is mad at Cap for saying were said in Age of Ultron. \"We'll lose.\" \"Then we'll do that together too.\"\n\nAnt-man - establishes that Hank Pym used to work at shield\n\nAlso of note is the Agent Carter TV series, which introduces the character of Edwin Jarvis who cameos in this movie.

Don't forget that we blocked Venezuela and Cuva's aid after Katrina, and they don't tend to use humanitarian aid to justify foreign intervention.\n\n&gt;It also had food, medicine, and basic supplies. Who's overthrowing governments with chicken wire? Do you know what chicken wire is?\n\nYeah, it is used for rioting. Maduro accepted aid from Russia and China and a host of other countries who did not express overt attempt at regime change, wonder what's got him weary about getting aid from Uncle \"Let's Coup every fucking country in the World\" Sam.\nSo it's racist to sit on a train now?\nHad the same thought\nThe ratings are indicative of Lebron not being in contention.

San Diego is the only somewhat progun big city in California, and we have by far the lowest homicide rate compared to LA and SF, even though SF has no gun store in city limits. \n\nOr look at West Virginia. Absolutely dirt poor, with high gun ownership. Should be a recipe for disaster right? In fact, their homicide rate, while nothing to brag about at around 4 per 100k, is below the national average of 5.5 per 100k. \n\nThe places driving our homicide rate are cities like Chicago, Baltimore, St. Louis, and so on. They have third world homicide rates ranging from 15 per 100k all the way to 60 per 100k. And most have plenty of gun laws.\n\nIt's hilarious you mention Texas, which has a homicide rate that is usually equal to California's most years, even though California has way more gun laws.\nAnother day, another broken country, another loss of two innocent lives, another group of people who will never feel safe again no matter what setting they're in.

I‚Äôve heard making non-violent offenders able to vote again being an option on the table for a while now, which would include a lot of these white collar criminals, but just because it‚Äôs (rapists and murderers) a small number comparatively doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not worth addressing in the law itself. Seems like it would be more logical to just make some exceptions in the law for these instances than to just dismiss it with a hand wave and say it‚Äôs fine because it‚Äôs a minority of felons. As if it‚Äôs either ALL felons can vote or NO felons can vote, which is a false dichotomy; you can allow some/most felons to vote if you write the law as such. I think Florida‚Äôs amendment restores voting rights to all felons except murder and sexual offenses or something to that effect.

It's a weird thing I've been noticing as I work more in the line of business I'm in. Rich people who sell their massive houses usually sell them furnished. They don't move their shit out, it comes with the house; the new owners just toss it or leave it all. It's so bizarre compared to every move I've ever made, but I've always rented so maybe it's normal? Just seems weird that people have paid a fortune and hand-picked every stick of furniture and every piece of art, every nick nack... then they just leave it and buy new shit.

It's never happened.\n\nThe Revolutionary War in the US is much different than the situation is Venezuela. It was the colonies collectively working together with a common government and army against another country. This is more like a civil war. The Civil War in the US is an example you are seeking, except it was unsuccessful for the people resisting the government. Not saying the current dictator in Venezuela is the good guy or anything, just saying having guns isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. This is a complex situation and I'm not saying people shouldn't be able to rise up and fight for what they believe, I'm simply saying that having a gun doesn't give you the power you necessarily think it does. Unorganized civilians with guns is not an Army, has no infrastructure, and is not a match for a military or police forces. The best thing people can do is continue to protest, I don't think a few shootouts in the streets are going to change much. It will take time for the economic sanctions and pressure from the outside to make Maduro step down but a little time is a much better price than a bloody civil war.\nFun Fact: if you homebrew, you can make light beer by adding Beano (the supplement to reduce bloating/gas).  Beano is an enzyme that can break down complex starches into fermentable sugars.  This means you need less grain (and starch) to get the same alcohol content (and the yeast is using up some calories) without worry of over mashing \n\nBut starches give \"body\" and \"mouth feel\" which is why light beer often seems thin.\nHello /u/David-Triguero!

Any person over 18 years old that can pass a low-level background check run by the store can buy long guns, and anyone over 21 can buy hand guns too.  Open carry is permit-free, so in a way, the mass shooter isn‚Äôt even breaking the law until they‚Äôre inside the building and fire the first shot.\n\nThe minimal burden at the bottom - requiring a safety course and issuing through police department (naturally skeptical of citizens having guns) rather than a private dealer (who actively wants to sell guns - as many as possible) - makes the big difference in gun violence. \n\nI‚Äôd be curious to know how many mass shooters had concealed carry permits though.\nthursday?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: holy poop, just confirmed  you're right -- Senate hearings are tomorrow - hot DAMN\nOh, there is also not a lot of knowledge about what is going on in the Vale beyond the Knights of the Vale.\nThank you so very much.

Nakia and Sif weren't even in the movie, and I'm sure they would have put Nakia in the scene if they got Lupita Nyong'o in the movie. Sif would probably raise to many questions. I already explained to you why it's a stupid to compare to 12 male characters showing up. \nThe reason there aren't as many female characters, is because the people that watch these movies used to be mainly men, but it's starting to change, which is why you're starting to see more female characters on screen. There also aren't nearly as many iconic female Marvel characters to adapt to the big screen as there are male characters, which makes it more difficult to have as many females on screen. Not to mention that having more female characters, just for the sake of having as many of them as male characters is the wrong way to go about it. If the character is great, and there's a big demand for it, make a movie about him or her. Don't make a movie about a character, just because she's a woman.\nThe point is that the scene was forced and genuinely took people out of the movie, men and women alike. The characters didn't gather there because the story warranted it, they didn't even know each other, and after they had their girl power money shot, they didn't even do anything together, they just went about killing goons individually. It was so obvious and in your face that I'm surprised there's actually people defending it.\nis this an apple advertisement?\nAre you serious? Do you realize this isn‚Äôt Fortnite?

What are Tyrion and the rest of the south supposed to do? Daenerys has two dragons (three at the time of the Tarly's execution) and two full armies that she's controlling. And I flat out disagree with the notion that Tyrion as a character HAD to do something even if he disagreed with the killing of the Tarly's. Followers questioning the decisions of their leader without acting is something that happens in real life. The consequences of Daenerys' actions are that people don't view her the same as they used to; Tyrion and Varys have lost some faith in her. We still haven't seen the end of her story either, so let's see how it plays out. \n\n2. The Waif was sent to kill Arya, and Arya fended her off, killing her in the process. Is she supposed to be penalized for surviving and fighting for her life? We saw the consequences of Arya's actions of killing Meryn Trant, they just didn't play out with Arya losing her life, it was the Waif. The Many-Faced God was repaid with a face. Furthermore, we've always known that Jaqen H'ghar is somewhat fond of Arya, so it's not out of character that he would allow her to leave. She completed her training.\n\n3. The stories of Dorne, The Reach and The Stormlands were complete. And if you disagree with me, that's fine, but sometimes you have to sacrifice story for other story. There are only so many episodes in a season, and so many seasons of a show. I don't feel like I missed anything in those locations.\n\n4. The people of the North realized that they needed the Wildlings on their side to fight the war, and Jon made this point numerous times after being questioned about it.\n\n5. Tyrion's strategic blunders have been acknowledged by Dany, but again, the story isn't complete. She clearly thinks that he is still the best person for the job despite some errors in judgment, which she approved by the way, so it's not all on him.\n\n6. Cersei is the clear next in line after Tommen's death. She's the blood of the former king and there's nobody else that could fill the role. She's also ruling with an iron fist, so people are scared of her. She has The Mountain by her side and just showed that she is capable and willing to kill a lot of people. Who's going to challenge that? The people of King's Landing so they can get wiped out by the Lannister Army? And you're right, I don't care at all that Kevan Lannister was killed and i'm glad no more time was spent on that. He was a worthless character.\n\n7. The Dothraki charging into battle was meant to draw the Night King out so Dany and Jon could jump him with their dragons. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to win the war. Did it play out as intended? No. Was it the absolute optimal strategic decision? No. Jon and Dany aren't great war tacticians and they did make strafing runs over the horde of Wights, but Dany decided to pursue the NK and Jon went after her. Dany isn't a rational character, so this isn't a plot hole in my opinion.\nSorry ill just turn on my be happy switch now and mysteriously make all my problems vanish to the back of my mind.

I also likely didn‚Äôt masturbate because I couldn‚Äôt orgasm just by my hands, so I stopped trying. But once I was 17 and had my first orgasm with someone else, I bought a vibrator online without my parents knowing and have been masturbating regularly since, only with the use of a vibrator.  \n\nHOWEVER, if I ever have kids, particularly girls, I certainly will do what your wife did and help my daughter by her first vibrator at an age which children typically start masturbating (like 12-14) and have an open and candid conversation with them about masturbating and what is healthy and what isn‚Äôt, and which vibrators can be used with which lube, etc. if I have boys, I would ensure my husband or the boys father have a similar conversation with him, but them lube and tissues and whatever else they may need, and talk to them  about the same types of things, what‚Äôs healthy and unhealthy, and about porn and what is realistic and what isn‚Äôt and to make sure they understand that porn is imaginary. Girls need this conversation too. I would ensure that my daughters knows that the conversations we have together are confidential and aren‚Äôt shared with my husband or her siblings (similar to conversations about puberty and mensuration), and I except the same to happen with my husband and my son, however we each need to know that these conversations are taking place so neither one is surprised. But I do understand why your wife hid it from you, she wanted her daughter to trust her and knew that you would react the way you did, but she probably should have gone about it in a different way. \n\n You NEED to start early with these conversations and sex positivity because if you start too late, like 16 or 17, there‚Äôs a good chance your child has already started having sex and thinks they know everything already, these conversations need to start far earlier than you may think is appropriate for them to be effective. \n\nI teach high school sex Ed, mainly to freshmen, and by the time I get to the sex ed unit with my kiddos, who are an average age of 14, many of them are already sexual active and already think they know everything about sex And are unwilling to listen to me... 12 is NOT too early for a young woman to start exploring her body sexually, and it‚Äôs far better to be under the guidance of her mom than entirely on her own, possibly sticking things up her vagina and causing a yeast infection or never getting the opportunity to orgasm on her own and then jumping into sex far too early just for sexual gratification.\n\nMy advice to you is to give up the fight about your daughter owning a vibrator bought by her mother and start a conversation with your wife about being a team and making these decisions together. Realize that while you are your daughters parent, your wife is a woman and knows a bit more about female sexuality than you do and that you may be wrong on this one, but you BOTH should be discussing these things together privately before discussing them with your children. Your issue isn‚Äôt that your wife allowed your daughter to buy a vibratory to masturbate with, your issue is your communication with your wife, THATS what you need to work on.\nDo you understand how that makes me look?\nJake and Logan Paul\nyes\n do you have what i want\nIdunno, if the whole world already knows and watched me do it 3 times in a row?

But the decision was made for Ruffalo to do the motion capture and for the Hulk's appearance to be based on Ruffalo so that the audience wouldn't have as much of a disconnect between Banner and Hulk. It was done to solidify the idea that Banner and Hulk are two sides of the same coin.\nThis assumes that the only difference between wide open shots and contested shots is the need to desire to draw fouls. It is also plausible that contested shots need more power, arc or something else compared to a wide open shots. SC's argument would be more convincing comparing other good shoots (say, Curry, Durant, Klay, among others) and comparing there contested versus wide open shots. Otherwise, I don't think we have convincing evidence.\nthe basic layer method.

If the only goal was to draw out the generals what was all the rest of this for? \n\nThere was no defensive statigy, Tyrion had a great chance to make himself useful the past few weeks and design a defence. John has never had to defend a position he's been on a wall for years. Create barriers, make the only walkers that can get over the fire the generals.

The reality is that you don't know her. She is a pathological liar who likely has never been entirely honest with you. You are infatuated with her, you have been manipulated into longing for fragments and moments of time with her, but this can't be what love is.\n\nAnd that will be the hard part. Finally admitting that you sunk all this energy into a lost cause. And I get it, we all go through it, sunk cost is what keeps many of us trapped in hopeless scenarios where we convince ourselves we can't let go because we've already put so much in. But eventually you just have to stop and let go.\n\nYou aren't giving her the benefit of the doubt. You are living in outright denial. What is the line in the sand, how many lies does she have to tell before it is too much?\nIt's just two old guys complaining.\nCole's back on SmackDown, MAGGLE?\nI voted McCain and Romney in my first two elections. Neither one inspired much confidence and it was more of an ‚Äúanyone but Obama‚Äù attitude because I could smell the charlatan style corruption from miles away.\n\nLooking back, I realized I was too young to really know how bad McCain and Romney really were in terms of being RINOs. We also didn‚Äôt quite have the info we have today. Both elections were terrible choices but all my worst fears about Obama ended up being true. I was for Paul in 2012 but I knew he had no real shot.\n[Don't make Komi-san sad.](https://i.imgur.com/9Ult3M0.png)\nDoes this kid not understand a joke, it doesn't have to be funny.\n&gt;Arys Oakheart had 1 chapter (2?) and he died immediately. Arys Oakheart is the dumbest character in the series.\n\nNot sure how having one chapter and dying is a metric for intelligence?\n\n&gt;She makes those blunders because she's losing her mind. I don't know how you missed that. That's why we have Cersei's POV in that book, to see her descent into madness.\n\nSaying that she is \"losing her mind\" is a gross exaggeration. Cersei is paranoid about prophecy after Joffrey's death and that's it. She is not exactly mad in a medical sense. And Cersei was always stupid, from the very beginning. It wasn't as apparent initially because there was always someone who had her under control - Robert, Tyrion, Tywin. The only time before Tywin's death when she was in charge was shortly after Ned's death and Tywin was so appalled at how the things were handled, he quickly sent Tyrion to take charge instead.\n\n&gt;Also, Cersei makes similar blunders in the show. Like legitimizing and militarizing the sparrows.\n\nYes, because the showwriters wanted to adapt that storyline.\n\n&gt;Cersei in the books also organizes the downfall of Margaery. In the show, she doesn't really do shit to bring down Margaery. Instead a male whore does it in the most convoluted way.\n\nShe tried to organise Margaery's downfall, what she did organise was in fact her own downfall as she fell into the very trap she herself created for Margaery. While Margaery is about to go free relatively untouched and the Tyrells took over KL. All because of Cersei's \"plan\".\nIf this is a dank meme, **Upvote** this comment!\n\n\nIf this is not a dank meme, **Downvote** this comment!\n\n\nIf this post breaks the rules, **report** it and **Downvote** this comment!\n\n\n^Thank ^you ^for ^helping ^us ^in ^keeping ^/r/dankmemes ^dank.

What you mean is you have no fucking clue how property taxes in the city work. Those 5k houses were gutted ruins that needed 50k+ in Reno and would cost 20k a year in taxes even after 2008‚Äôs NEZ.\n\nI personally, like a lot of people with credit, wasn‚Äôt looking for the utter gamble of property spec and being a shitty slum lord - but was invested in an actual business.\n\nDetroit‚Äôs property taxes did not go by market value, they went by city appraised value - which was often time 10x the market value, or more, especially in BE or Indian Village.\n\nI grew up in Warrendale and lived in various neighborhoods my entire life save a stint as a teenager and my time in Iraq. I‚Äôve lived everywhere from SW to Delray to the East Side to Downtown and even in the end, around Eastern Market - where some friends owned a building and when they rejected a low ball price from out of state investors they started hammering us with inspectors until they were forced to sell due to code violation fines for dumb, bureaucratic shit.\n\nDo you think people in Detroit 15 years ago just had the money and credit to engage in housing speculation - or compete with outside money that came flooding in after 2008? Everyone was trying to hold on to what they had left. This comment is astoundingly divorced from reality. Bizzaro world shit.\n\nhttps://prospect.org/article/destruction-black-wealth\n\nUp until 2011, when I left, the proceeding years were not ripe with opportunity - they were a desperate struggle. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just get a bumch of lines of credit to buy a bunch of \ndilapidated assets you have no assurance will ever actually mature while paying obscene taxes - in the midst of a housing bubble, or the intervening catastrophe following‚Äù. How shit, what?\n\nNo, you didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsupport Detroit‚Äù by sticking a D on the back of your car, coming down for DEMF or to stumble back to the MGM lot after getting blotto at McShanes or Greektown from OLdS. You were engaging in commerce, trade - that‚Äôs it.\n\nNo I would not live on the east side again. Why would I? My people are all gone. The connections, friends, family, business partners - two decades worth of social capital scattered to the wind.\n\nI left to another city to go to university and stayed abouts. I make sure to not clean up my neighborhood TOO much, not to make the bus stops TOO much, because it‚Äôs all that‚Äôs keeping a 5 guys off my corner and a Dan Gilbert from realizing we‚Äôre conveniently close to downtown. I may own my house now, but a lot my neighbors don‚Äôt - and I recognize that a city is people, not a just a place for people to come play in once in a while.\n\nAnd for real, I used to walk all the way down Grand River from E. Grand to the Leland on Friday‚Äôs/Saturday‚Äôs and never had a problem -   Corktown was never even that bad, and far better than tons of areas further from downtown including the one I lived in. You just couldn‚Äôt walk around drunk and clueless. That‚Äôs it.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go read some Community Economic Development from any Uni if you actually desire to have an informed opinion - MSU has plenty of good, empirical, work.

I feel you should be allowed to feel this way about seeing your daughter looking at these kind of things but I don't think you approached the situation in the best way, maybe talking to her and getting some woman's insight from your wife may have resulted in a better outcome. Although your wife has a valid point in trying to help along a healthy sex life she shouldn't have undermined your parental authority like that in front of your daughter. You should talk to your wife in private about respecting each other's authority as well as talk to your daughter together in order to help her and work out some understanding among the three of you. I know it may be uncomfortable to talk about these things but it's better than having your daughter grow up thinking sex is a bad thing that shouldn't be thought of or even becoming rebellious and doing things she really shouldn't. Do what you will with this advice and I hope it goes well for you and your family.\nOh yeah they‚Äôre definitely starting to bring older items out. This is the third item in like a week from 2018\nYeah, I hear you. Just horrible writing and logistics all around this episode. Very annoying when you sit down and think about it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/v5VnIGxAPts\nThis is maybe the sickest most disgusting lie he told. It takes the worst day in any parents life and twists it into a lie an order to score political points. What he describes has literally never happen as he says. No mother carries a baby to full term to only decide for no reason to just end its life. These are babies born to unbelievable pain and no prospects for making it more than a few days or weeks at most. \n\nBut it also implies that if it were up to Trump he would allow babies with terminal diseases that are suffering unbearable pain to continue to suffer for days or weeks. If he doesn‚Äôt think letting these infants pass and their parents mourn is the humane thing to do, I would like him to say what should happen.\nReagan and Trump. Two presidents with Alzheimer's.\nI was severely bullied. I was jumped and beat up numerous times in my neighborhood and in the park across the street from my house. I couldn't tell my parents because my dad was a quadriplegic and it would break his heart.\n\nIn third grade I was beat up by the class bully IN THE CLASS ROOM whenever the teacher left the room. One time, one of the bullies saw me getting on the church bus after dinner to go to a revival and he got on too. At the revival, he walked up to me and busted my lip open.\n\nI was one of those kids who were probably just one more beating, one more embarrassment, one more terrifying day away from finding a weapon. Hell, I'm 50 years old and I still haven't been able to put these issues to bed. We just had our 30 class reunion and I haven't attended a single one because no one knew much about me other than I was the punching bag for the bullies.\n\nI know that's a lot of my life's story but I wanted to share it with all of the \"former\" bullies and ask you, if you're victims were standing in front of you right now, what would you be able to say to them?\nNot sure about this one in Romania yet!

Every time they pull something like this and lose, it makes them look stupid, and their polls a joke.\nYeah they certainly are the losers here, they are pawns effectively, but I am trying to do my part and prevent people from being manipulated by the US and the US media trying to get us involved in another war by playing on our emotions. Of course nobody wants to see others suffer, but that's why before every war the US specifically plays the \"humanitarian\" card. Remember how we were going to save the Iraqi people from Saddam?

Luck is just in everything. In unreal tournament and quake its basically a quest to dominate the power up rotation once you get a good gun also its a case of spawning near a good gun, getting to the power ups first etc. Fighting games its a case of guessing the right frame and the right counter at the right time. its a lot harder than it sounds but man have I beat people way better than me by having them not be able guess my mix ups and flow charts and being able to read their current strategy then i win quit, I have also lost to people way worse than me pressing random ass buttons because somehow them not following the game rules works and and I just happened to start off with a combo with enough frames to be countered. Like using a different move I coulda won its rock, paper, scissors with more options but luck is still very much there. Titan fall 2 A good team thats balanced out can get fucked up if the worse team has 2 really good players distributing the damage just between them getting their titans out first and changing the game tide. Hell in real life competition luck exists. If I could remove luck from the equation of mma and video games I would....Scratch that just remove it it when luck works against me. There is just no such thing as fair. Luck is always random and always a huge influence over everything. Like if you were able to have every competition where the competitors were close in skill through out history play out a 100 different times who knows how the result would be each time. I bet they wouldn't be the same each time. Also fighting games are the most fair games on this planet and the least played. It almost like people don't like something thats fair and hitting a wall when ranking up or consistently getting their ass beat 1 on 1 by someone better once they reach a certain rank.\nLol, they never change the formula.  Our salary freezes began in 2005.  My savings and investments stopped shortly thereafter.  You know, sometimes it's just nice to cut yourself a big old slice of the pie, that you baked, and eat it on the front porch while you watch the world go by.  I've done this on numerous occasions and have never regretted it.\nThe actual problem is that your star player needs basically the whole court as his landing space with the way he jumps.

So now the priority is keeping them accountable for their new commitments.\nSo they had her kill the knight king but that has nothing to do with them foreshadowing her becoming a good fighter since literally episode 1? What was the point in her training then? Arya's entire timeline has basically been \"I dont want to be a princess I want to be a knight\" but her purpose in the plot cant have anything to do with killing someone of importance?\nI could see how people dislike those being his motives after GRRM said he was strongly opposed to having pure destructive evil in his stories. The night king is the dark lord figure he hates.\nYou could also look into getting a usb mixing board you can use on the ps4. I plan on getting one in the future.\nUBC are not that big of a deal but a psych eval cross the line. As it would not be covered under insurance, getting a PsyD or an Psychiatrist to do an assessment is about $350 to $500. \n\nThis is if you can find one to do the assessment that will not be biased or the state does not impose abortion clinic like restrictions on them.\nChanged my life.

My thinking is simple, maybe too, but cats are not non-endemic, black rats. Australia is not a tiny, pure, insular spot on the map. This seems like an expensive and brutish recourse to take. It's kind of a stab in the back too. The cats were definitely put there by people; they were willfully introduced by people. Used for everything from pest control to companionship for generations. And they can be controlled. We had a colony at the park for years. The only time it grew was when someone threw their cat away there thinking the cat would adapt to the colony.

It's very obvious. \n\n&gt;Of COURSE the chair has input. Every senator has input! \n\nEvery Senator has input for their own assignments.  There are no votes on committee members.  The decisions are made by the party leader.  And no Democrat has control over who the Republicans put on the committee.  And you can't throw people off the committee without good reason (think Steve King).  The Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee in the 102nd Congress (1991-1993) were the exact same as the members in the 101st Congress.  So you're seriously blaming Joe Biden because, after the 1988 elections, Democrats didn't put Barbara Mikulski on the committee in preparation for a Supreme Court hearing in 1991?  Absolutely ridiculous.   You're stretching like no one has ever stretched before to find a way to blame Joe Biden. \n\n&gt;Just because the chair isn't the *final arbiter* doesn't mean they don't have a say.  I said *input*, not control. At the very least, they have their own vote and their own voice when the committee members are chosen.

Even say that the fuel is free to drive the car, you'd have to spend at least the amount you pay for the car/ins/maint/etc (only for fuel) to drive the truck to make buying and driving the car start to make sense.    \n\nEven then, the cost of fuel isn't free so you would only be saving the delta cost between the car and truck.    \n\n...that is a looooooot of miles.\nOf course, no one is 100% invested in every show they watch.

I think a lot of folks don't understand that upper middle class still means working for a living, actually earning your wages. Those who earn wages in the six figure range pay the highest overall taxes (even after accounting for FICA). They pay way, way more than the average uber rich person who gets their income through dividends or other capital gains and only pays 15% (less than half the less wealthy guy/woman who earns a wage).

Or like. Or at least tolerate. Someone else commented that they started playing go and while go specifically might not be your thing, strategy and talent based activities that engage your mind are really good choices as well. Knitting/sewing/crochet, writing/reading/painting/sculpting/playing music, woodworking, etc......... bonus points if it engages your hands and body as well as your mind. \n\nAlso, you‚Äôre onto something with your bird.

They could have replayed the 911 tape. They could have called the 911 caller back. They could have checked in house/ public records for the phone number. If it was a cell phone, they could have contacted the service provider and obtained subscriber information.\n\nIt gets busy sometimes and things can fall through the cracks, but given the nature of the call and the fact that two officers spent 30 minutes looking for the address I think more should have been done.\n\nEdit: I skimmed the article and missed that the suspect called from a 911 phone. My other points still stand. If someone calls in reporting they're going to commit a murder and your officers can't find the address you better get a supervisor to pull the recording.\nI've just been diagnosed with ITP (less than a month ago), and I'm curious how you're able to tell when you're getting low.

My husband and I barely had two nickels to rub together.  I took my two small children grocery shopping,  and our car died in the parking lot.  I had no phone and no one I knew in town.\n\nThe kids and I walked six or eight blocks down the road to the local hospital.   I got the kids warmed up and they let me use their phone...but no one would give me a ride, not even the local cab service,  because my carseats were still in the broken-down car.\n\nThe lady at the front desk got ahold of a hospital volunteer.   This lady bought my kids a meal, took us home, and gave me a 20 as she left.\n\nAwesome,  right?  But it gets better.\n\nDid I mention how broke we were?  The kids were getting a few secondhand toys, but there was no money for presents.  This lady came back to our house, with bag after bag of stuff.  Groceries,  household necessities,  socks and gloves for the children...even nicely wrapped, new presents for the kids.

Best wishes to you and yours as well!\nGoing inside other peoples houses. I feel like I‚Äôm not nice enough to the owners of the houses and I‚Äôm taking up space and air. One time I visited my friends house and her parents yelled at me for not cleaning their house (we didn‚Äôt even make a mess) and threw me in their stuffy garage that heavily smelled of cigarettes and alcohol. Not to mention they had hung up pornography EVERYWHERE in their house, so to say the least, I was uncomfortable. And her parents yelled at me like a dog. For not cleaning THEIR house when we didn‚Äôt even make a mess! We were in their for like 15 minutes talking and the parents strolled in like ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt the house clean?‚Äù I said ‚Äú...what? We didn‚Äôt make a mess, this is how it was!‚Äù And long story short the dad was yelling ‚ÄúGET IN THE GARAGE NOW!

Also you do concede then that Toaru is a good battle academy and thus it's not right to say that the genre is trash when there exists one such case of it working well. It's like isekai, the genre is filled to the brim with trash, but if the author knows how to play their cards right then it would be good.

String some fairy (regular white Christmas lights) lights, drop some couch cushions &amp; pillows, cover it with a quilt, and call it good. Finger sandwiches are simple, pimento cheese spread, lunchmeat, cream cheese and olives, whatever kind you like. Over 21, bottle of cheap wine, under 21, empty wine bottle washed and filled with apple or grape cider. Potato salad if you like it, chips if you don't. Pie or cake for dessert, and voila!  Bonus points for doing it around sunset or midnight, watch the sunset or the stars while you eat and have nice cuddly time.\n\nWalk on the beach. It's literally free. Grab buckets, collect shells or stones that you find along the way, then when you get home, do artsy things with them (the internet will be your inspiration, there are too many sea-gathered object art projects to list here).\n\nCook dinner together; spaghetti and garlic bread is a classic, and you don't have to be a 5 star chef to pull off something edible. Candles and nice china if you have it, or just more fairy lights and whatever regular dishes.\n\nGo to the library, and each of you pick out a book for the other to read. Make a playlist of some of your favorite songs, and the  you'll have several dates- reading dates, then discussing both books dates.  Don't like to read?

Lots of fast close ups where you could just barely parse which dragon was which.\nTechnically, Team Cap chose not to sign the Accords\nI don't think so.  Jamie's redemption arc is under way.  He loves Tyrion and Cercei has sent Bronn to kill them.  My latest theory is that Bronn is going to try and kill either Dany or Tyrion and somehow will actually kill Sansa which will cause Tyrion to lose his shit and become ruthless again.  In my opinion, Tyrion and Jamie are getting back together.  Jamie is going to want her out of power but alive and Tyrion is going to want her dead for Sansa.  It would be really interesting.\nTo each thire own\nRight, but in reality it's worse than that. They constantly make changes *for the sake of making changes*. Champion reworks abound.\nThey gave her the Smackdown title in 2017 so I think that gesture isn‚Äôt needed now. And there‚Äôs a big difference between Natalya and Kofi. He was in The New Day who have been the most over group since New Age Outlaws. Natalya has never been over like that. \n\nNot to mention you had the color issue with Kofi which made so many of us want to see him win the belt because black individuals rarely get the big belt. Natalya is another white blonde woman who already held the biggest belt.\n\n I know you didn‚Äôt directly imply they were similar by the way so I‚Äôm not trying to jump on you for your comment. Just stating why in my opinion it wouldn‚Äôt work.

Natasha couldn't have been dead on the ground, because she was already dead on a distant planet in an alternate timeline. The Chitari wouldn't be flying away into a wormhole to reach Earth, because the battle took place on Earth, so they'd be flying towards Tony, not away.\n\nAnd of course, if Tony hadn't stolen the Infinity Stones, everyone would've been dusted, (*everyone* including the Chitari) so that situation couldn't have happened, because nothing would happen, because there'd be nothing left to happen.\n\nMost importantly Steve would never have said \"You could've saved us.\" He wouldn't put the blame on Tony. If it was a real vision of a possible future he would've said something more along the lines of \"We could've done more.\"\nWho is kayfabing Papa Meltz with this shit?\nDude should've gone down with his comrades...

We‚Äôve also seen now that the pieces were laid out for Arya to kill the NK very early on between her meeting with Melisandre, and meeting the Hound and Beric, and to some degree even Gendry.\nI'm starting to wonder if I am wasting my braincells on debating with you. Did your interest shift to semantics now? Are you a low-grade troll I fell for? You demand answers and arguments, but fail to acknowledge any of your conversation partners.\n\nOne last try.\n\nWhen people discuss \"loot boxes\", they do so with the background of corporate greed and microtransactions. The 'loot boxes' in MK11 (yes, there are boxes of loot, albeit not fully random, but rather predetermined for all players, and simply location-swapped per player, thus everyone gets the same rewards) are not guarded behind microtransactions. Money cannot be used to attain them.\n\nSo yes, you could theoretically argue that they maintain the spirit of greedy evil corporations by providing players with a dopamine hit that could potentially be seen as exploitative, but again, real money is not involved in the attainment of these boxes, and whether or not people unlock them makes no monetary difference to the company.\n\nThus, they are moot to the general point of this discussion.

It doesn't matter if you are an assassin, she's not invisible and she's not even quick. The library scene showed her sneaking around the undead in a closed environment.

Visited Sean‚Äôs Bar a few years ago and love everything about it: the pour of the beer, the smell of peat from the fireplace, the kick-ass live music and the cross-section of ages all sharing the space together.\nBecause jerking around a circle helps so much more\nLove that lil chest\nYou're out of  your element.\n\nWhat are the default settings of \"those TV's?\" There is no standard for the television hardware manufacturers, so using a reference monitor in the studio is required and editing/grading to a standard is required. The same is true in audio production.\n\nThe issues some people had with the episode were either due to compression caused by the CDN's distributing the content being overloaded and having to compensate with more compression, or people who have their TV's set up improperly (or some combination of both.)\n\nWhether you are creating audio or video content, it's not the creator's job to set up your listening/viewing equipment properly. If a musical artist releases a song with experimental deep bass tones under 60Hz, and I have my equalizer set to not play sounds under 60Hz, is it the artist's fault? Should the artist restrict his creativity to account for bad speaker setup or my EQ preferences? It's all fine and dandy testing something on a decent car stereo system, but what about a car stereo that has the EQ set up in a funky way due to the user? How do you account for that? Adjusting it to match the improperly set up equipment will ruin it on other equipment.\n\nThe same applies to this episode. It was a battle fought in a blizzard in the middle of the night. If it were bright, it wouldn't be realistic or convey the mood that was intended. If people have set their TV to a high contrast mode that crushes highlights and lowlight details, that's not the creators fault. Saying it is, shows a rudimentary understanding of how the technology behind it all works.\n\nNo one said anything about being poor. You can use a shitty TV and as long as it is set up properly, you can see everything just fine. I've downloaded a copy of the episode, all details are within spec. per my testing. I have a shitty LED TV in my garage, and I can see everything just fine on the shitty TV, as well as my OLED TV, because both are calibrated correctly.\n\nIf you've gone back and viewed it on your TV again now that compression/distribution aren't as much of an issue, and you still can't see the details in the dark scenes, you'll be much more productive if you spent your time learning how to do a basic calibration on your TV, then complaining about how professionals who are at the top of their game (or else they wouldn't be working on the worlds most popular and anticipated show,) are bad at their job.\nI can see him adding some in actually since everyone expects drive or 3 now.

You sweats call first time players \"bots\", yet most people need time to learn, to play, and Epic caters to them with so many optional helpful experiences, and people still are angry about it. They have provided more than most game companies do in a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ***Please, give Epic a break***\nExcept prehistorically... I wish I could see a real dinosaur!\nI wonder if they will acknowledge where Daniel Bryan has been\nWow surprised the comment section hasn't been treated as all dissidents of this brutal socialist regime and locked up.\nYou're dismissing a strategy as a fuck-up. Big mistake in these times.\nAll the easy \"do this free thing outside\" stuff is taken. So I'll give you an offbeat idea, though not strictly a *date*:  \nHave a \"Dollar Store Anniversary / Christmas / Birthday / etc.\" Make it so that everything for the celebration *must* come from a dollar store. Try and make it as thoughtful as possible, but no individual thing can be more than a couple of dollars. Bundling / building things out of $1 parts definitely encouraged. Everything else for the party also has to come from the dollar store, including any food (angel food cake mix, anyone?).  \n\nI'm actually stealing this idea from some wealthy friends of mine who hated the consumerism of the holidays, but still liked the \"fun\" of opening gifts.

Sansa, Arya, Bran all younger siblings. The hound, a younger sibling. Dany, a younger sibling.

It is unreliable as hell and has managed to widely miss its ratings of movies with general market sentiment due to its use of questionable pre-release review options and especially because of its sham weighted average formula.\n\nFrom the way you post it seriously seems like you are an unemployed college student.

Also, depending on the timeline for the spinoff, I'll give that a watch. \n\nAt this point, with Winds, I'm willing to wait 9 more years. But at the very least THAT book is coming. Wtf knows when, but it is. Spring in the other hand........ holy crap.\n\nEDIT: speaking of fakeouts, and the one that made me drop TWD, Glenn's dumpster \"death\" was the worst thing I've seen on a mainstream show.\nI could be wrong but if it should also make Rosenstein free to testify publicly without interference from Trump and co.\nI was like \"Wtf is Wrath Hammers?\" Lol.

I completely agree.\nEveryone is saying Compton is a great idea, and honestly, theyre definitely wrong. Compton is a neighborhood. If the Clippers want to claim a part of LA, and still have a sizeable fanbase, they should claim the San Fernando Valley. Not many people know this, but if SFV was considered its own city separate from LA, they would be the 5th and 8th most populous cities in America. It's a twin metropolis. Add on to that the fact that there is no sports team that represents SFV in any pro league and it seems like a no brainer to me.\nHello /u/danielmaira,\n\nThank you for your submission.

NK was filet mignon from a Michelin 3-star restaurant. I've had the filet mignon, I don't even want to look at the McNuggets.

The fathers reaction was unideal, but the shock is understandable. \n\nI'm totally fine with any 12 year old begining to mature sexually, but there is a long process ahead and certain things should be left to blossom naturally, not to be ushered in haphazardly. Parents buying vibrators for their 12 year old girl is a weird line to draw, surely there is an age where it would be inappropriate and if Reddit found out Daddy was buying his 8 year old daughter vibrators I'd be curious to see if they had the same opinion and also to see where the arbitrary line appeared. Do we have parents buying 11 year old boys flesh lights and pornhub accounts? Goodness surely you learn with your hands and work up to toys? \n\nWe made it thousands of years without these sorts of things and now people are throwing dildos around like they're a human right.\nNo marching orders yet.

Nah, I didn‚Äôt miss that.\n\n&gt;Or when a White Walker kicked Jon and he flew like 10 yards?\n\nYeah, and crossbow bolts can hurl someone backward five feet and pin them against a wall without any recoil on the shooter. It‚Äôs a TV show, it looks cool.\n\nNone of these constitutes proof that it‚Äôs impossible to get the drop on a WW or the NK specifically. They‚Äôre strong and fast. So are like half the main characters. Like I said, we‚Äôve seen them killed already.\n\n&gt;Not to mention if you watch that scene again he holds her for a good second or two before she even drops the dagger. He had more than enough time to tear her apart he just inexplicably paused for dramatic effect because the plot demanded it.\n\nWWs still take time to process information. Arya was ready and NK wasn‚Äôt. This is such a weird quibble. It‚Äôs not like they locked eyes and screamed at each other for a half hour like a DBZ fight.\n\n&gt;My point here is that the NK has a reputation. He nearly wiped out all of civilization in the past. I'm really supposed to believe no one could get the drop on him if it's this easy? That's what seems illogical to me.\n\nAt what point during the last 10,000 years or whatever did the NK expose himself enough that anyone could stab him? At what point was he ever so close to victory that he might be distracted enough to let his guard down? They even make a point of his hubris with all his little smirks.\n\n&gt;He was built up since the first episode as a force of nature, something greater than the realms of men that would punish them for their petty squables over the Iron Throne. That has been repeated over and over and over again so many times it's impossible to miss. Instead of being that force of nature punishing a divided humanity he vanishes in one night against the first line of defense passed the Wall.\n\nIf he‚Äôs supposed to teach them the error of squabbling over thrones, that‚Äôs pretty clearly your own prediction rather than anything explicitly said in the show. Sorry that didn‚Äôt pan out, but that‚Äôs the issue with predictions I guess.\n\n&gt;Really? Nedd Stark loses his head because he chose honor over saving his own neck. Robb Stark and his family are massacred because he did not honor his responsibilities as a Lord. Stannis has his army destroyed because he was too stubborn and lost his humanity in his lust for the throne and failed to see through Melisandre's lies, sacrificing the only thing that mattered to him and losing the faith of his men. Jon Snow fought for the greater good against tradition to help the Wildlings and paid the price of being massacred by his own men.\n\nWho learned anything from this stuff?

I don't mean this to be rude but they're basically written at a lay person level. That's not a bad thing, but I don't think these books are *currently* contributing anything to literature moreso than the other major fantasy series out there.  I think Martin *has* helped some people get back into reading, which is a special accomplishment IMO.  \n\nThe lore and complexity is what makes them exceptional, but Martin is really struggling with that complexity.

I am not sure Cap can even fix them all, i suspect he failed anyway. He probably lived to an old life somewhere else too. \n\nMy question is this, when he is sent back in time to put the stones back, how does he get to the real timeline to do so? The devices they have lets you go past in your timeline and start a new branch. Nowhere did they discuss labeling and going to specific branches. I suspect he went back and attempted to put stuff back in place, to only end up leaving two of each stone, not that it matters. I just dont get how he can come back to timeline a as old, because again he has no way to select a specific branch. Only way to come back to your branch is to use the main quantum machine, which bounces you back to your 'home'. But he didnt come back on the device, which means he time traveled to get there when he came back old.\n\n\nAlso i still dont know how nebula 2014 made it to 2023, when she gave her pym particles away to Thanos.\nIt always drives me crazy when people say the world is \"crazy\" now and you can't let kids play alone outside bc you never know what predators are out there.

How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - \"Call of Duty\", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and \"pressing F\". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice. I know I certainly get the impression of you acting like that bobbing duck toy (as shown). Are you a reasonable human being or a bobbing duck toy? Ask yourself that.

I work with children and teens and have attended numerous seminars (edit: seminars about what to look for concerning possible abuse and neglect) and one of the things we're told to look out for is children participating in sexual behavior that is too mature for them. \n\nEveryone here is saying \"but 12 year olds masturbate\" and that is absolutely true. Children often begin to do so as young as 5. That's not the issue here, and hearing that a preteen was masturbating shouldn't raise red flags for anyone. Hearing that a 12-year-old has been given a SEX TOY by her PARENTS would ABSOLUTELY raise red flags for many people. It is not normal for her age, puberty or no she emotionally she is still a child.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to you.

Seems cool.\n**\"I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one guy and I ran away\"**, explains the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe popular and much loved character of the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, would surely have faced them sword in hand. But the actor, the real person, has been more cautious. The fact is that the Argentine actor, who has never hidden his passion for football and more specifically for the San Lorenzo de Almagro, to the point that he took a pin from his club during the last Oscars Awards, has explained how he escaped a dangerous brawl with ultras from Real Madrid.\n\nThe radical fans attacked him thinking he was a Barcelona fan. It happened in 2006 when Viggo Mortensen, who was immersed in the shooting of Captain Alatriste's film, was mistaken for a Bar√ßa supporter.\n\nThe actor decided to tell the anecdote 13 years later. It was the day in which his team lost 1-7 against Boca, a match he saw in Madrid with director Agust√≠n D√≠az Yanes. The director invited him to dinner at his house, preparing for the occasion. \"I took flags, shirts, hats, scarves ... Then they make us a goal, two goals, three goals ... I sank in the armchair\", reveals in radio 'Vorterix'.\n\nHowever, the worst came after the game. \"I was in the Puerta del Sol, the ultras saw the colors of my clothing and thought i was a Bar√ßa supporter. Those bald guys started to say ugly things and hitting me. I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one and I ran away. \"\n\nWhen arriving at the house of Agust√≠n D√≠az Yanes, the director asked him if it was blood what he wore on his shirt. Not to worry his friend, he said no, that it was wine.\n&gt; I dont think Barr is shocked or unprepared for this scenario where Barr both received a disapproving letter from Mueller\n\nI agree. This is all part of their circus strategy of hating on truth in media and praising Fox News as the only official media.  They are winning the game via media nonsense and chaos.\nBut there in lies the fault. The Philippines is not socialist, yet their President calls for drug dealers and users to be murdered in the street, and they do it. Turkey is not socialist, yet Edrogan just consolidated more power, and is now a dictator on that country. He used a fake coup to round up as many dissidents and people who opposed him as he could, and now they are \"in special camps\" probably dead, and they had no relation to the \"military coup\" that took place. The problem is when someone who already has the tendency to abuse power gets a small taste of unchecked power, they abuse the fuck out of it. Not every leader will abuse their power, like how not every person who gambles will become addicted, but in those few cases where it does happen, death and destruction follow.\nNTA. Literally at all.

They're just telling you that it's the CURRENT reason.\n\nCO2 spikes have happened before in Earth's geological history‚Ä¶ but there hasn't been a natural reason for THIS spike‚Ä¶ and it's quite a fucking massive spike. So when you break it down it looks like this:\n\n- We know that CO2 warms the planet.\n- We know that CO2 can be released in massive quantities naturally because that's happened before.\n- We know that such a massive natural release hasn't happened recently.\n- We know that a massive man-made release has been happening constantly for the last century+\n- We can see from records and ice sampling that the recent CO2 releases are very significant.\n- When you add all that up, **we are the volcano.**\n\nThis is also very basic logic.\n\nSome people like to argue that the amount we release is small compared to massive volcanoes, which is true, but it's also CONSTANT. We're doing it 24/7 for over a hundred years and we're doing more and more every day.

She saw the Empire take her father and kill her mother. It was a supremely powerful force imposed on her world while her childhood heroes (parents) could do nothing against it. Her adoptive father fought the Empire, but he devolved into impotent madness and abandoned her. As far as Jyn is concerned, the Empire is invincible while the Rebels are pathetically delusional.\n\nThen the turn. Her father is alive. Not only alive but still resisting. He was never beaten by the Empire, he was playing the long game. He was avenging Jyn's mother and pulling the wool over the man who broke up their family. And he needs Jyn's help. She rushes to help her father, but all she can salvage is his mission and dying wish. She's not an angsty pessimist anymore; she's a child desperate to keep her family's legacy going. Desperate to cling to this last spark of hope and to punish the Empire in a meaningful way.\n\nJyn doesn't really care about the Rebellion's members or their politics, only in the shared goal of hurting the Empire. Her speech feels forced because it kinda is. She isn't sold on the Rebellion so much as on her Father's specific plan. In a way, she's a very human character for this.\nNot sure why you're getting down voted so hard but, I really haven't heard good things about the franchise since around that time.

The legal precedent to deny felons rights is there, and the civilian support for those laws is also there. So you are fighting not only against the laws, but the will of the civilian population, which is an uphill battle. It also doesn't help that there is no moral basis for either argument, like the case with gay rights, where it's clearly immoral to deny people equal rights based on their sexuality.\nWho tipped them off?

Even during school. Even when I claimed my diagnosis (which was incorrect, I actually don‚Äôt have depression or anxiety, but something arguably worse) I was sure not to flaunt it.

In short, I don‚Äôt know that this is an unpopular opinion or not, but I do think we‚Äôre going to hit the point where saying you have this stuff will mean nothing. I know I already scroll past when I would have stopped and listened not 5 years earlier.\nThere really needs to be an avenue for NBA players to discuss and voice their problems with officiating without being fined. We can't get a solution without that. If you keep fining players for talking about officiating, and you don't even give them a chance to say something, then how can we ever get to a solution?\n\nSo yea - First things first -  there needs to be transparency and an open avenue for discussion - then we can talk about the specifics of calls/fouls/rules/etc. afterwards.\nBroken thumb/surgery towards the end of the season.

I'd also like to say that the alarming messages included death threats so ya know, not exactly looking too favourable on that topic currently.\n\nTo answer one of the most debated things here, you can look at the use of guns in two ways: They act as a deterrent, or they escalate.\n\nIf we take the first road, owning guns act as a deterrent because the threat of harm will prevent offensive action being taken. This is the exact same view that some countries have towards nuclear weapons and is equally a contentious topic. Your neighbour owns a gun, so therefore you are less likely to burgle him because he might shoot you, right?\n\nBut what if you too had a gun, and you bring it with you? Now you've got two offensive weapons and an incredibly dangerous situation. This is a likely outcome if you are legally allowed to own them.\n\nThe second road is what lead to the Cuba Missile Crisis and, shockingly, the reason that it was deescalated was through diplomacy and the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Turkey (and debatably Italy too). The fact that the US had a vastly superior arsenal did not factor into either sides decision-making process.\n\nThe removal of the weapons (guns if we drop the analogy) lead to a de-escalation of tensions. The likelihood of someone shooting you is dramatically decreased if guns are illegal or far more tightly regulated. Yes, there will be cases where one person has a gun and the other is unarmed and dies as a result, but those are the outliers and are such a minuscule amount of cases.\nDont know what you want me to say, that because Bush was the worst president in life by miles I should say Obama was awesome?  \n\nBy comparison to Bush, Obama was awesome.  I voted for Obama every time I could. \n\nDoes that mean he did no wrong? \n\nI dont believe so.  If you are saying Obama was perfect then you are putting party ahead of country. Which I find people here do.  Republicans do the same.  \n\nThat does not mean both parties are the same.  It just means people like you have the same faults as Republicans who support Trump\nHe has one. I had one. We had one together. 3 total. But yeah.

Largely a homogenous population.\n\nWe (USA) have a large melting pot of a population, and as such have widely different demands of our healthcare system. It's much easier to prepare and maintain treatments for people with similar genetic backgrounds. Same for generally unified cultures. Most likely due to dietary and environmental factors. The same cannot be said for the US. It's too big, too different, and generally not very efficiently managed in a centralized manner.\n\nWe do have a strong economy and abundant resources. Is it strongly enough to scale and support unified healthcare for our diverse population? I have a tendency to think it will balloon out of control and will not work. Costs will be astronomical, much more so than projections. I mean look at our VA system. This should be the shining example of what socialized healthcare should be in the US. We should be taking care of our soldiers, but the VA is generally trash. Veterans healthcare outcomes suck. I mean if you can't trust them to take care of those who gave all, can you trust them to take care of those who have nothing? I have no faith in that system.\n\nIt's also proven we aren't smart enough to manage our money responsibly. Take a look at any government ledger. Further adding to it being more infeasible.\n\nI get that you think socialized healthcare is some magic bullet, but it isn't. The argument was more Norway has just about perfect conditions to pull this off, and even then it still has issues. I don't think the US could effectively pull it off and the conditions to do it aren't really there. Can it be better than it is? Certainly.\nRight in the America's ass\nThey had something like 6-8 years where they could have created a good plan as replacement for the ACA and they never even proposed one.\nAny ‚Äú*Blank* Reacts‚Äù youtubers.

Essentially, CP seems to believe that what makes a thing 'bad' is whether or not you are caught doing it. \n\nYou can understand so much of CP's career in light of this comment. From the punching of dicks, the flopping, his routine excessive contact, etc. all of the things people dislike about CP are summed up in that exchange.

It‚Äôs completely unrecognizable from Seasons 1-4 of the ‚Äúmoving image.‚Äù When people make bad decisions in Seasons 1-4, they pay for it with their life or another way. Ned Stark died because he made bad decisions. Robb died because he made bad decisions. Anyone used to be subject to the basic law of consequences. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you were thought of as a main character, if your character flaw showed itself in a bad decision, you were screwed. But now, people get away with mistake after mistake. Instead of earning their place, now a writer just gives it to them. Most of the should be dead, not only from last night, but from mistakes and poor decision during the last few seasons. Arya shouldn‚Äôt even be there to save the day because she was stabbed in the abdomen and then swam in the sewers. Meanwhile Ned Stark barely survives an infection from a stab in the leg and Drago dies of infection from a mere flesh wound. There were consequences before and plot armor didn‚Äôt save you.

The government agreed to maintain a ratio but instead inflated unsustainably, created diplomatic crises when other countries wanted to reclaim their gold reserves over the overleveraged money supply and ultimately reneged on the deal by closing the \"gold window\". \n\n-------------\n\n\nre: 2 \n\nCrypto-currencies do not function as money yet because they do not have established markets and are currently used as speculative instruments.  Money needs markets. Without markets nothing can be money. This is why governments when creating legal tender make it a tool for paying taxes and other legal debts thus *forcing* a creation of the markets.\n\nThe fact that governments do whatever they can to fight them - because at this stage crypto prevents government control of money supply - is also important, but it's also a fact that crypto is in its infancy. Markets develop over time. You can develop markets for precious metals and you can develop markets for cigarettes.  To state \"it's not money\" without qualifiers is a sign of ignorance.\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nre: 3\n\nCentral banks do nothing but continue with rampant inflation of the money supply. It's just being coordinated so relative inflation remains low but if you wonder where the sudden spikes in prices of certain goods like education, healthcare or housing comes from... all from inflation being re-directed into those markets.\n\nWhat is relative inflation? Well since all currencies are free-floating and their value depends on supply and demand you can hide inflation by forcing all emitters of money to inflate at an agreed-upon rate. This leads to lack of capital flight between currencies and limits the amount of inflation that can be seen by the depreciation of currency vs other currencies. But the cost of living vs income continues to widen over long term.\n\nAlso to understand relative inflation check the exchange rate for Swiss Franc during the Euro crisis around 2013 or so. Swiss Franc shot into the sky and the Swiss central bank was forced to expand money supply massively to prevent death by strangulation with overvaluation of the Franc vs Euro, Dollar and Pound.\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nre: 4\n\nMost of \"genius economists\" are not genius \"economists\". Friedman was a poor economist, as was Keynes, as was Krugman, as was Stiglitz. Most of those people were known for their political economy as well and creating policy prescriptions and rationalizations rather than developing methodology, models and providing new insights. \n\nThe real  \"genius economists\" were often non-economists, like Nash because real economics is boring. Opinions on why you getting the money is right and ignorant moralizing on the other hand - which is what you do - is soo very popular.\n\nAlso Hayek's prize came for re-formulation of the theory of the business cycle which while not his own is the only attempt at correct explanation of the purely economic dimension of the business cycle. Keynes talks about animal instincts which explains motivation but not why markets magically find mountains of money to speculate with. Hayek explained it - as well as how the booms form and how they are ultimately always doomed to fail. He also explained that it is not the bust but the boom which is the \"Bad\" part and bust simply re-sets the economy to a healthy equilibrium. That it costs businesses, jobs and savings is the fault of the boom and not the correction.\n\nNo other widely recognized economist did that since most want to get paid by government institutions so they say the politically correct line - the one you are repeating - which is economically wrong but politically correct. And that is apparently more important. Bad economics is good economics when it is good for politicians.\n\n\n--------------------------\n\n\nre: 5\n\nConsidering that the alternative in Chile and Portugal was a communist revolution... yes he did care about *relative* freedom. He was also an economist so he focused on real alternatives and economic freedom, not imaginary freedoms that leftist authoritarians proclaim as they take over and monopolize entire economies and then proceed to steal resources that \"belong to the people\" at a much greater rate than the worst capitalist.\n\nHayek also criticized the western capitalist model and was far more lenient toward certain government programs (although not toward their efficiency or the real motivation behind them) than for example Friedman. \n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nTo sum things up. Where did you learn your economics?  Perhaps you should try some pop-econ books or you tube. It could get you started because clearly you are out of your depth here.\nReminds me of the jumping Jack man.\nBtw dude, excellent thread starter. I'm just trying to debate and show my viewpoints.

After the opposition won a super majority, Maduro and his allies stripped the national assembly of all power, and created a constituent national assembly.  The new Constituent national assembly maduro created made new last minute rules to running in the election, those rules barred a lot of opposition from running.  This was also why they protested and view the election as illegitimate, because they don't recognize the power of the constituent assembly.\n\n&gt;Guaido did not even run in the last election, nobody voted for him president.

If it wouldn‚Äôt be okay if other kids did it, it isn‚Äôt okay for her to do it. With that said, at that age I (I was born female and identify as female) played on a boys football team. I was the best and strongest player on that team by a long shot. Kids at that age regardless of gender are very similar and in fact males mature less quickly, i was slightly bigger than my teammates at the time but I was also a good athlete and had been playing many sports my whole life. B√©a being a good player probably has little to do with the fact that she‚Äôs a m to f transgender person. I would not bring the fact that her team tends to win up, i just don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs relevant. She may just be talented. Also, keep in mind that children can be prejudice towards people who they perceive as different from them. Not to say that your kid is, but just to keep that in mind too and be sure to hear what B√©a and her parents have to say. There‚Äôs a good chance Bea experiences bullying in some capacity and she may be acting out. Be gentle with the situation, but the school and her parents need to make sure she‚Äôs well behaved. Maybe teachers go easier on her because of the fact that she‚Äôs trans, which clearly is of no benefit to her or anybody else. Just be gentle with the situation and refer to her with her proper pronouns. Her trans-ness isn‚Äôt the problem, the school not properly disciplining her is and they need to hold her to the same standard as everyone else.\nDoesnt it seem too childish for second grade?

I recently sold a pair of brand new in the box shoes on eBay with pictures of the size of the shoes(on the tongue and on the box). Someone purchased the shoes, received them and then messaged me that the shoes didn't fit and they must have been men's size X and not women's size X(they weren't). I offered a refund if she sent the shoes back in the condition she received them(at this point she hadn't gone through the official eBay returns procedure). She sent back the original box I sent her, with the original shoebox inside that box with all the packing materials, and no shoes. Empty box. Then messaged me a bunch asking where her refund was, and that the shoes were in the box, etc. etc. I basically told her she knew damn well she shipped me an empty box.  She contacted eBay and requested a refund and that they look at the case, and then they issued her a refund from my PayPal. I had to get eBay involved and they looked through our message history and then they refunded me back the money and I reported her(always use eBay messenger!). It was a major pain in the ass, and eBay almost always sides with the buyer. You also can't leave bad feedback for a buyer, so you'll never know if someone buying your stuff has pulled this shit before. I'm guessing she tried to pull something like this before since they quickly refunded my cash. Now every auction I do is a no returns auction. \n\nTL;DR Lady returns empty box, still tries to get money, eBay gives it to her, then gives it back to me, probably because she's done this before.\nMissandei and grey worm then given the throne because of white guilt.\nNot sure that will happen lol.

Obviously the events leading to it  would be different than the ones we've seen in the actual episode , but  humor me.\n\n\"Daenerys,  Jorah and Jon are surrounded by the Whitewalkers in the Godswood. Jorah  is mortally wounded, gasping for his last breaths in the arms of his  queen. Jon draws his sword and prepares for the onslaught. As the  Whitewalkers rush the trio, Daenerys sees something in the sky above  them. She hesitates for a moment but as Jon is overwhelmed by the  frenzied enemies, she grips Jorah tighter and screams at the top of her  lungs. ‚ÄúDrakkarys!‚Äù. Two massive plumes of fire bathe the ground where  our heroes and the horde of Whitewalkers occupy. The Night King turns  his sight from Bran to witness the fire. What a moment ago was a swirl  of cloth and iron and undead flesh and bone is now a pile of drifting  ashes, with the exception of two figures that still linger in the  cinders.\n\nLooking up from her hands that  now hold charcoal dust, Daenerys sees a bewildered, unscathed, unburned  Jon. She now knows that his words were true. And Jon himself fully  realizes for the first time that same truth as his eyes meet the  surprised gaze of the Night King. ‚ÄúAzor Ahai‚Äù, Mellisandre whispers  under her breath. A faint smile forms in Bran's face. With his blade  still glowing red from the dragonfire baptism and his scorched armor  that makes the cold rain hiss as it touches it, a reassured Aegon  Targaryen hurls with fury towards the Frozen Lord.\n\nSteel  clashes as the two make contact. As the fight goes on, Jon realizes  that fury and righteousness alone are no match to the old magic of his  foe. The Night King is better than him. \"Far Better\". Thrown to the  ground after a failed attack, the northman feels desperation clutching  him into its icy claws. Towering over him ready to deliver the final  blow, the Night King's eyes catch a glimpse of a shadow just out of  sight. There's something there. Someone. Noone.\"\n\nI'll  leave it up to you guys to finish this eventuality.\nWhite knight over here\nWild, was super surprised\nThis never makes sense to me when people say this.\n\nIf you like most craft beers, then you're not averse to hoppy bitter notes.

But the others he killed could have done the same thing soo....I take it back.\nYTA. Masturbation is completely normal, and you should be thankful that she wants a sex toy, instead of seeking out a guy that could:\n\nA: Get her pregnant.\n\nB: Give her an infection/disease\n\nC. Start a harmful relationship when she is still young and developing.\n\nI could keep going, but I have things to do. Bottom line, a sextoy is a perfectly good way to keep her safe and sexually satisfied until she decides to make the next step to adulthood. She can‚Äôt get a baby or disease from herself\nI had a lot of time between summer classes and marching band. I rarely got time alone with boyfriends (this was in my first year of hs) and so I snuck into a bathroom with my bf at the time and we were making out. He was awkwardly loud about it so we got caught by a janitor and the vice principal expelled us from summer school for it. There were 2 weeks left. I had to redo both of those classes.\nI thought that said Sansa and Theon and I was thinking that you missed an important part of the episode\nI can not explain the significance of Sonic to me. It was my older brothers favorite game and character without a doubt. Sonic gave us a way to bond before he passed. The fact that they fucked up the way Sonic looks so bad makes me so god damn upset its not even funny. I've always wanted a sonic movie. I'm devastated that Sonic looks so stupid, and because of that, i will not be going to see this movie.

However, I am constantly blown away by all there is in this world. I don‚Äôt want to die, not because I am afraid of death, but because I don‚Äôt want this ride to stop. \n\nI want to know what it will be like when we first get off this rock and colonize another planet. I want to see another star system. I want to be there when we cure disease, figure out abundant clean energy, and when we accidentally create life that is much more intelligent than we are. \n\nThe problem is, that without death a lot of the experiences I have had wouldn‚Äôt have quite as much oomph (very technical).\nI liked it (obviously). I enjoy how much character development there was in that movie for all of the characters. I think it‚Äôs one of the best sequels I‚Äôve ever seen which is why I rank it so high.

Everyone is saying you're going to damage your daughters sexuality whereas I'd say the opposite. Your daughters first sexual experimentation shouldn't be using a vibrator. That's excessive fot her age and not a good baseline to set. She can use her fingers and work up to getting toys when she can buy them herself.

My issue with the removal is:). Resubmitting a removed post without prior moderator approval can result in a ban.\nCould be your right. Supposedly there is magic there. They talk about no one knowing what‚Äôs in the lower levels. Maybe something was disturbed or destroyed down there. We could still get some kind of supernatural stark stuff. Most likely though there isn‚Äôt enough time to go into anything real new. The crypts are probably done but there is a chance and I think it would be cool.\nI would say the latest is at whatever point I would start considering it cheating. If you're dating non-exclusively and can still fuck others, it's not *necessary* to bring it up right away. If you *only* date exclusively, I'd bring it up immediately. I think it'd be best to bring it up as early as possible since it might be a deal breaker for some people, but I have to imagine that people who consider porn cheating don't date non-exclusively for long, if at all. \n\nIt's hard for me to say though, since as I mentioned I'm not the one that feels that way, and I'm a heavy communicator. It's basically my love-language. So if I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with someone, I'd probably already be incompatible with them. Plus I'm married, so it's quite a non-issue these days.\n\nBut talking about our beliefs and why we have them is one of the first things I do when bonding with someone. So it would come up naturally for me very quickly. Like, before we started dating or on the first date. I don't think that would change if my views happened to be more conservative than they actually are.\nThe problem isn't leaving the religion. It's acting like an authority on the subject, leading to Islamophobes leaping on what they say as if they are the true, rational voice regarding Islam when anyone with a rudimentary education in the matter can see they're full of hot air.\nWearing your watch on your right arm?

I thought the scene with jon and theo trying to do that was a good depiction of that. And I thought it was great that he just instantly spins around and grabs her not only by the neck but the dagger hand at the same time. If we are to believe that she is so fast and sneaky that she can just waltz on past white walkers while SPRINTING AT FULL SPEED, and the nighking says \"nope, that's not gonna work on me\" you just expect me to believe he's going to stand there and just stare at her? he's clearly stronger/smarter/faster than any ONE person alone. shit was lame as fuck arya should be dead just from him grabbing and crushing her throat with a subzero degree ice grip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fine with her killing the nightking. that's not what I'm upset about. They just should have had it actually be something well thought out. They backed themselves into a corner on the writing and gave us this cheese fest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty much 100% certain that the books are going to be like a completely different ending because there's no way that shit is believable.\nEvery prisoner is a hostage.

The issue is that these minor crimes can be turned into \"bigger deals\" because people may not have the money or time afford it in the first place.

But it's happened to other people.\n\nThis shit can be abused and we can find things that are \"wrong\" with people we don't like. Races we don't like. Jail them, and because they are jailed, strip away their voting rights. These criminals are US citizens, whether you like it or not, and I'm pretty sure that they, too, want to better the country they live in. The issue is that we permanently lable a prisoner as a terrible human being, no matter the crime or sentence served. America doesn't care about prisoners and they don't want them to get better, either. Most prisoners are people just like you and me.

But I think the context is important. Last Dab is hot, it gives me hiccups and makes me salivate but its bearable and I think the reaction the guests have is the reaction most people would have. It's manageable and you can compose yourself after trying some. So that's why I'd say it's not too bad in this context.

It's a sad thought, but one that was backed by some compelling information.\n\nEdit 2: also, the whole of scientific investigation is making a hypothesis and then going about proving it wrong or right.

I get that you're trying to keep faith in your favourite show and it's writers but be realistic man. You're telling me the best strategy was to give complete and utter control to their enemy and hope he'll leave an opening? That's retardedly bad. Giving your opponent complete control is the worst possible thing. I'm pretty sure the forces of the living *only* needed to trade about 10 to 1 in order to win this fight, maybe like 15:1 if you include recently dead that become raised to fight for the dead. Now 10/15 to 1 isn't exactly ideal, but it isn't exactly unprecedented either for a defending force to achieve this with superior tactics, defenders advantage and high level execution. I'd much rather destroy his whole army and possibly risk his escape (although dragons are probably pretty good at catching runaways) than sacrificing the vast, vast , majority of my forces and HOPING I can predict what an undead being does when he's already killed everybody I know and care about.\n\nNice try tho homie\nFound the SJW chick....\nI didnt bully anyone into anything.

It was about a 15 hour drive and we were about 13 and a half hours into it. The drive was pretty much a straight shot on the same highway, I-95.\n\nIt was about 1am and we‚Äôd planned to push through so we could get to the hotel by 3am and at least sleep in a bed instead of the truck. My husband was driving since I‚Äôd not had much experience driving his truck, but he was starting to get tired and I‚Äôd offered to drive since he was fading. \n\nSuddenly, we come upon this stretch of Highway that was by far the creepiest, most intense thing I‚Äôve ever seen. The north bound side (other side) of the highway, on a desolate stretch of road, had been completely shut down in both directions. Huge, football-field style spot lights were set up and illuminating the bone chilling scene below. There was an over-turned, burned up tractor trailer, lay across the highway. There were 6-7 completely annihilated, burned up cars - or they could‚Äôve been trucks or SUVs. There was no telling. \n\nThere was soot, blood, sawdust, and some kind of dark fluid all over the road. Surrounding the scene were parked, turned off emergency vehicles. Probably 30 different cars/fire trucks/ambulances/etc., all sitting around the perimeter of the carnage. The scene, though so brightly illuminated we thought we were on a movie set, was completely deserted and silent. No people. No emergency lights. Just a brightly lit horrifying and completely abandoned wreckage site. \n\nWe were somewhere in South Carolina. I think the town was called Florence. \n\nFound out later that there was a horrible fatal wreck in which a whole family died around 7pm the night before, and they‚Äôd just left the entire miles-long stretch of highway closed for hours because clean up had been too much to handle that night. \n\n\nThat woke us both up to the point of primal fear. I had never seen such a horrible wreckage in my life, my hands were shaking. My husband white knuckled it the final two hours, barely breathing. We both swore we kept seeing figures in the shadows of the shoulder the rest of the drive.\nHonest answer, yes it has actually. I have won 8 season 1 games with a total kill count of 54 because what me and my friends usually do is grab guns that we're comfortable in using and then wait for the other teams to take each-other out while waiting for the last 2 squads to battle and as soon as it turns to 2 squads left, we engage and usually get em while they're injured. It's quite cheesy but in my head, it's playing smart and it's worked 8 times.\n\n[Screenshot for proof](https://i.imgur.com/dWzbT1j.png)\n\"Its not how you drive your car.

Trees can also live for thousands of years before they die... I am all about high tech solutions where lower tech ones will not work... but we seriously need to educate engineers, architects, city planners and other professionals about basic biological principals. One of my favorite examples is scaffolding... bamboo is so much better than steel, and while it will release that carbon it holds once it decomposes.. that carbon was in the air a few decades  before. Where as producing steel is all carbon that has been locked away for thousands of years. \nAlso the idea that all of the carbon is stored away in plant tissue above ground is incorrect. 50-70 percent of carbon at least in boreal ecosystems is present in tree roots and their associated fungi.. these fungi are often the decomposers of leaf litter and twigs.. however fungal tissue is mostly carbon as well. so much of the carbon stored in plants ends up stored in the soils, fungi. In trees like redwoods those root systems often outlive what we think of as trees. \nJust a few thoughts.. but hey we should be attempting lots of different solutions . and im not an expert on carbon capture by any means. i also recognize that planting trees alone will not be enough..\nA side note buried at the bottom of a long NYT piece is not the same as his actual words of all his past dirty deeds showing up on the first page of a google search and included in every forum conversation about him.\n\nhttps://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-pardon.html?mcubz=0\n\n&gt; Throughout the deliberations, Mr. Bush consulted with Attorney General William P.

Maybe you could have approached it more carefully, but my main question is how you and your wife could butt heads so hard on this. Do you two have opposite political ideologies? Most married couples, especially with 12 year old children, should know each other well enough to know where they'd stand on this kind of thing. That being said, the feminists commenting of course exaggerate that you just basically did the worst thing in the world. I'm not going to go into my deep and nuanced views on why SOME sexual repression is a good thing, but in short it's what was required for society's to protect their women and therefore their continued existence. Feminism was needed before because it liberated women from traditions and roles that became obsolete with our society's advancement and development. That doesn't mean that it's not gone WAY too far now. You are not the asshole, because the onus was on your wife to keep you in the loop from the get go. Despite what they say, it is your business and not just your wife and daughters.\nWhat people don‚Äôt realize are that the US Government facilitated the ability for unqualified borrowers to take out mortgages.

We know that getting more lux, ezreal, ahri, etc skins is inevitable and getting virtually 0 skins for some other champs is going to happen but making lots of noise and trying to pressure riot via this noise on social media raises our chances from 0% to 0.5% of them making a skin for our favorite champs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a completely separate note, there must be some people who work on the skin team at riot who are sick of making skins for the same champs over and over again.

My dad and his family always respected me a lot for that (divorced a while later).\nThen I grew up and stopped thinking about me, and realised that my older brother wasn‚Äôt weak, he just came out on a different way; he turned into a genuinely good person. Everyone adores him, he resolved the conflicts with dialogue and became someone amazing. He is very kind, gentle, funny and always sacrifices himself happily for pleasing the people around him. He did not get into an outstanding university, but graduated, worked really hard, and obtained everything through his own blood, sweat and tears. And never heard him complain about anything even when I knew he wasn‚Äôt specially enjoying it.\nOn the other hand, I got into a great uni, and I‚Äôm also working, but I‚Äôm not like him.

Losing money selling oil is a phenomenal achievement.\nYou have literally no perspective for a 12 year old girl. Honestly, sit down.

In fact they only asked women about what age they were when they started specifically using a vibrator. The fact that only 17% of women reported using vibrators before the age of 20 could quite possibly be due to access more than choice or interest... many of us used alternative methods and objects because of the lack of availability or the associated shame or stigma. Also your \"logical\" assumption has no basis in logic at all- there's no reason to assume females dont masturbate until they're 17+. That idea may make you more comfortable but the fact is females often reach full sexual maturity by age 15 and many of us explored our genital pleasures well before that age... just like males do.\nB-but MURICA is the freest country on earth ! /s\n&gt; It is something that just doesn't happen on the scale it does in America, and a large factor in that is the ease of gun access.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_truck_attack\n\nA truck in France killed 86 people and injured 458 more.

My friend works in a cafeteria of a hospital and encouraged me to apply there. I figured it could be nice because I wanted a job in the city and the trauma unit had an opening. \n\nAfter about three months I decided to quit. It was one of the most poorly run units I have ever seen. I got a new job pretty quickly and told my friend we could still hang out often because I ended up staying in the city. \n\nMy friend blew up on me and said I need to give her $1,000. It turns out she filled out a referral form at the hospital when I applied. They were short on nurses and were offering $1,000 to anyone who referred one and were subsequently hired. I received a $1,000 sign on bonus as well when I got hired. I didn't think anything of it because that's common for nurses in this area. I manage my money well though and will just be paying back the bonus. I didn't even know my friend was getting a bonus. I didn't even know she filled out a form about me. The fine print says she also has to pay back a bonus since I didn't stay on board for a year. Again, I knew nothing about her getting a bonus.\n\nShe said she doesn't have the money to pay it back and I need to give her the money. She told me I needed to stop being a greedy bitch. I told her she can return her fancy $800 iPad to cover it if I'm such a bitch then. It's funny because I remember wondering how she could afford an iPad Pro when she's strapped for cash all the time.

She'll get jobs, but during the first few months she gets fired for not showing up. Her kids have a roof over their head and food and everything, but they always look like they need a bath, and they don't get much attention or mental stimulation, so they're developmentally behind.

But she drops the kids off at her grandparents' house a lot, and they at least get decently taken care of there.\n\nThe thing that makes me sad for her is that she steals money from her grandparents to make ends meet (instead of just showing up to work like a decent person). Not a lot of money at once, but like $20 here, $40 there. She's not on drugs or anything. She's just that lazy because she's never had to work for anything in her life. Her grandparents could call the cops on her for stealing (because she's stolen credit cards and stuff from them and in total has stolen over $10,000). And her grandparents aren't rich, they're like middle class, so this has affected them financially. But they don't call the cops because they know if authorities get involved, they'll take the kids away, and they've become really attached to the kids since they take care of them half the time. So they just turn a blind eye to it, and she keeps doing it because she knows she'll get away with it. Obviously, in this situation I am much more sad for her kids (and for her grandparents) than I am for her, but still. What kind of pathetic person steals money from their grandparents? That's a sad life.\nYeah slight difference being I'm not talking about comment sections. I'm talking about the actual networks.

He seized the initiative and beat the lannisters early - after that, he probably should've peaced out, traded jamie for his sisters, and went back north. Instead he pushed for too much - he would never be able to win given both the tyrells and lannisters, and the crownlands were all against him and the riverlands. The tyrells and lannisters have the most money and troops by far.

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nThe other day I had a chat with a friend that I haven't talked to in 4 months. I'd been wondering why but not really thought much of it. The chat was linking memes and laughing at them but then my friend had something to tell me. He told me why we hadn't talked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast new year‚Äôs I had a small get together with three friends and me. It was nothing big, mostly just us hanging out, playing video games and drinking while waiting for midnight. This guy was one of the guests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the conversation. He started listing reasons why he hadn't had the guts to write to me. One point being that he disliked my rats and them being out on my couch. He knew before he came that I have rats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis friend decided to tell me that he was disgusted because he had to sleep there and suddenly it wasn't one rat turd that he complained about, it was all my rats AND my bunny pissing and pooping all over the couch. He kept coming up with new excuses when I called him out and telling me about diagnoses, I‚Äôd never heard of before, as a base for his explanations. Another thing; I did offer my friends blankets and covers for the night. My friend straight up said no and that it was all okay. Fair enough, I thought and went to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen he tells me that his excuse for saying no was that his anxiety had been triggering him. I have anxiety myself, but diagnoses aside, I find it hard to believe that you would not say yes to a blanket when asked directly. Especially when you consider how disgusting mattresses (and sleeping couches) are without covers, rats or no rats. I'd spent so much time cleaning up my apartment and making everything spotless before the party, so to be told that I basically had to wrap everything in plastic to fit his standards was just insane to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to explain to him calmly why I thought his words were ridiculous before I went to bed for the night. Truth be told, I didn't want to lose our friendship over this, but I had to log off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext morning, there was a somewhat calm reply. Turned out the whole thing about my animals wasn't his problem. His problem was that he thought one of my other friends had been undermining him, despite this friend being super nice toward him and there were no indications of dislike between either of them during the party. I just gave up at that point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaven't talked to him since because I blocked him on everything. Despite all of this, I do see some points and it has made me wonder if I overreacted. Again, I get that anxiety can make you nervous and close in on yourself, so the whole blanket and rat situation seems a bit off to me? I guess I‚Äôm mostly confused if I‚Äôm right about calling him out for insulting my animals after being invited into my home?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is not how it begins for many people. Perhaps discovering masturbation before puberty is more common in women; I don't know. At any rate, it's not conditioned on awareness of sexuality, maybe not even on the capacity for sexual desire. I knew as a child when I masturbated on purpose that there was an emotional component to the resulting pleasure, but it was many, many years before I could conceive of those feelings as something to be created reciprocally with another person. The only social context I was aware of for that experience was that touching myself there for reasons other than hygienic necessity was dirty and shameful, and no one had even told me anything to that effect. I'm pretty positive the predominant effect of this episode is going to be to teach the daughter that masturbation is bad, with some ramifications probably not revealing themselves for a few years.\nEither every Pope is divinely appointed by God and therefore able to issue statements *Ex Cathedra* in an infallible judgement on what is right and wrong; or *no* Pope is divinely appointed by God and able to issue such. *Therefore* this letter discusses a Pope that was apparently divinely appointed by God and therefore able to issue pronouncements *Ex Cathedra* who is **apparently also a heretic**.

The three things that cause global warm are Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and water vapor. We can‚Äôt really do much about the water vapor, but we can do things about the other two. The main thing humans are doing to contribute to an increase in Methane right now is agriculture. Cows are the main producers or methane so we should cut down on meat production. I‚Äôm not saying ban cows like the green deal (which I‚Äôm so glad didn‚Äôt pass since it was just a cash grab), but to just cut down on it. Although I‚Äôm not so sure how and were we would make cuts. To address carbon dioxide emissions, I would cut down on air travel. One of the largest contributors to CO2 by human activity is air travel. We could have the super rich cut down on all their flying in private planes and jets. Also once the Tesla electric cars become more affordable it would be ideal if people were to switch to them. Although this is an ideal situation since some people won‚Äôt be able to switch if they are part of the lower income class. The last thing I would suggest is invest in Green and smart technology and research. The reason developed countries such as the US and Canada don‚Äôt look like modern day Mongolia, the Philippines and the smog cities in China, is because of our green technology. It will advance us forward as a species and possibly slow the deterioration of our home planet.\nI \"alternatively acquired\" it\nI don't carry currency fairly frequently when with my husband.

He makes you think Ned is the guy that's gonna solve it all and get to the root of the problem with the corrupt throne. Then it's Robb and Cat, with some aid from Renly. Then it's Stannis. But all of these were masterfully crafted red herrings. None of those characters were ever the \"main characters\" you just *thought* they were. The protagonists have always been Jon, Arya, Sansa, Theon to an extent, Dany, Bran (but I've got theories that he's not just a wholesome greenseer) If you look back at all of she sticky situations the actual main characters were in over the years, you can see that they were *never in real danger*. Why would Arya die a blind panhandler in bravos? Why would Sansa get tortured to death by ramsay Bolton? Ask yourself, \"for what purpose would this character die?\" and in every situation our main heroes were in over the years, them dying at that time made zero fucking sense. *There has always been plot armor*.

Probably the same for other crimes and ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù things.  Life just is significantly easier if you fit your culture‚Äôs definition of attractiveness (easier to get jobs, find partners and friends, confidence in social situations, etc). Of course this isn‚Äôt a hard set rule, but it‚Äôs definitely true. I‚Äôm not a model, but some people find me attractive and there have been several times in my life where I‚Äôve met someone, or had a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù/seemingly random opportunity that‚Äôs presented itself to me and I‚Äôm fairly sure it was partially because of physical appearance.   Every one of these things seems small, but I can see how overtime, if I wasn‚Äôt getting these little bumps of ‚Äúluck‚Äù, I might start getting bitter about the world being unfair and how I‚Äôm ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù.  This is the type of discontent that can drive someone to crime and other negative things.  This is obviously never an excuse for bad behaviors, but I think everyone should be grateful for any natural gifts they were given.

If they fire a ref because popular players like him then the sets a terrible precedent.

When I was 8 (this was sometime in May), the dream happened again, except it was this shadowy creature with green eyes. This was the night I finally realized I could just unlock my front door and escape the house -- so I did. When I got outside, this white bus parked on the side of the road close to my house. Of course, I didn't want to stay behind with the shadowy thing, so I got on. The bus took me to this academy where we were taught to fight these things called Nightmares. When I arrived, I met this dude who was about 2 years older than me, with dark hair and laurel gray/grayish-green eyes named Marcus. (There's a lot more detail before the next paragraph, but it would take a LONG time to write that, so I'll just explain the important bits there.)\n\nWhen I was maybe 14, I was asked by a teacher to go take some papers to the office. As I was walking, I noticed this group of shady-looking businessmen. After some investigation, Marcus and I discovered they were part of this evil corporation that wanted to basically overrun the world with Nightmares and awaken this ancient demon.\n\nThus began the epic quest of Marcus and I, and the companions we met along the way.\n\n(\\*Also, a note on how I'm distinguish **N**ightmares and **n**ightmares: Nightmares (with a capital N) are created by the corporation, kind of artificial things; they're inherently evil because that's how the corporation made them. The lowercase nightmares are organic/biological and not necessarily bad.)\n\nI'm not sure how related to this thread all of this technically is, but here's what I'm getting at:\n\nI've woken up about maybe a third into the final battle and have tried to go back to sleep to see how it ends, but it's been a few years and I still haven't dreamt about the rest of it.\n\n(If anyone wants to hear the full story in detail, let me know...?

Given a few months for brain cancer, went on for eleven years. Battle epilepsy, debt, cardiac condition-related problems, and the likes. One night, my aunt calls everybody over at her sister's house; me, being the rebellious teen that I was, didn't really want to go, having the black sheep brand and not being close with a part of the family at the time. After going out and getting my then girlfriend back home, I call him on the payphone all all this idiot is able to tell me is \"If you want to see your uncle, tonight is your last shot, I'm coming to get you\" and hangs up on me.\n\nThe tumor had finally won over the Temodal and chemo and had started growing at an out of control rate, out of the blue. My aunt now had to feed him, help him go take a leak, the works. And this lovable idiot, this goofhead, the guy that kept the whole goddamn family tied together for years, is sitting there, looking at the TV but not really comprehending what's going on, and *he's alone.*\n\nEverybody is sitting in the kitchen, conspiring and whispering and trying to plan the next moves, and he looks so scared, and I'm not even sure I can finish this post by now, but he sits there alone, like you'd sit down a kid in front of the TV to hush him, and I refuse for him to be alone, so I went and sit. It just seemed insane that they wouldn't at least try to spend some time with him, y'know?\n\nAnd we had a talk about the hockey season, and the whatnot, and he was confused, slowed, but *still there.* Out of nowhere he focuses on me, tells me that he wished he could've seen what kind of man I'd grow into, and see me happy with children and wife, and then pointed to the football match that was on and told me they sure had changed the rules for hockey, because he couldn't understand the game anymore. That's the last I heard from him and I'm still not able to deal with it.\n\n\nBonus points for when my grandmother passed alone years later after telling me she just misses me so much and why won't my mother visit more often?

I can't find if they recorded the word for sweet potato.\n\nAlso, variants of \\*kumala may be limited to Eastern Polynesian languages (the languages of Hawaii, Easter Island, New Zealand, Tahiti, the Cook Islands, etc). The time depth of Eastern Polynesian is not long‚Äîthey probably started to split apart around 1000 AD. So there hasn't actually been all that much time for the words to diverge too much. Beowulf was written around the same time and some Old English words are readily recognizable to modern speakers.\nRight, because that's a completely equivalent situation.\nI smell some r/HailCorporate stuff in here.\nNo. Too complex for this show.

Other QB‚Äôs taken in that draft that we‚Äôre available at 4 and taken before Dak are Paxton Lynch, Christian Hackenburg, Connor Cook, Jacoby Brisset, and Cody Kessler.

If you want to tell yourself that I downvoted you because I am some emotional tornado who can't laugh at himself, and not because you just made a cliche joke and pretentiously defended it as \"factual\" and \"forthcoming\" when someone called you out, then go ahead. I am not as obsessed as you are about approval from strangers on the internet as you are.\nNah I didn't care about the 1v1. I wanted him to stab Bran in the face lol.\nWell put, older generation tends to overlook the wildfire that is the internet. Some use it to their advantage, many are naive\nI don't believe that we are \"just letting it happen\". I mean, look, when this country was founded there were shootings and even \"mass shootings\" at a level we just don't have now. As our nation grew we implemented laws and educated people to the point that we are able to resolve disputes far more peacefully than we have in the past. \n\nThe problem is that we can only go so far with it before we begin to negatively affect what we hope to positively affect. A government can restrict speech more than our government currently does but there is an invisible line that it could cross which would have negative effects that would far outweigh any of the positives it had before then. This invisible line could be crossed decades before its consequences emerge, that line being something that chews its way through the perceived individualism our nation was built on.\n\nI believe the same holds true for both our first and second amendments. That invisible line has terrifying consequences and I don't even want to come close to crossing it. \n\nIf we agree that trying to be \"perfect\" isn't viable then we have settle for something less. What is that something? Is 0.00045% close enough to zero? It's a serious question. [Source is CDC based on approximately 15,000 gun related homicides in 2017 out of 330,000,000 people in the US.

Not be a dick like Jed York? Not have an OL that would get him killed like the Titans? Did he relocate the team to the AFC because Peyton had a strong preference for the conference so he didn‚Äôt have to compete with Eli?  Peyton was going to get a record setting deal wherever he went regardless. Elway having better people skills than Jed York doesn‚Äôt make him some great QB evaluator.  \n  \nElways best asset as a GM by far has been his acquisition of FA talent outside of Peyton, and that itself was helped by Peyton‚Äôs presence as it is. I‚Äôm not going to tell you he‚Äôs trash, he‚Äôs a decent GM, but the Peyton signing was more luck that Peyton was available right when he needed a miracle to move on from Tebowmania than it was some amazing act of GM work\nIf it was that easy it would've been made.\nNo mate, it's uphill all the way up till 45.

They are not. A Nobel prize in economics was handed out a few years ago proving this. People make decisions that benifited and conform to their immediate biases and needs. \n\nYou claim they are massaged the data but fail to show this. The data is out in the public and the techniques discussed in the research. \n\nYou are correct that there isn't anything special about women but from a sociatal view women tend to have more empathy and emotional intelligence because they are required by society to take on the role of the \"care taker\" which builds those skills.

I hope you feel better soon!\nI definitely agree with the essence of what you're saying but I feel like the right to act like a complete and total nutter is a fundamental American right. Until you're acting like a total nutter AND unable to follow the rules of the road or are a danger to yourself/others then it's really none of the police's business how off your gourd you seem. I haven't watched the video so I'm not speaking in specific reference to this incident, just in generalities. I don't think someone acting like a moron is justifiable reasonable suspicion or probable cause. But just like you said earlier, I'm not a police officer and never will be.\nThis is a foolish comparison, considering the US is the size of Europe. Would it make you feel better if he acknowledged that many of us have favorite restaurants in different states?\nBullets! My only weakness!\nRealistically, you would get one single flail, if you timed it very, very well, before the sheer mass of the wight horde pinned your sword, sword arm, and entire body to the point that you were completely immobilized. Wights don't puff into smoke on contact with Valyrian Steel, they just turn back into bodies. Bodies that have the exact same mass and momentum as they did a quarter second ago. Bodies that are still being propelled forward by the thousands of (very much still animate) wights directly behind them.\n\nSo no, even Valyrian Steel doesn't help anyone on the front line of that battle. The only thing that helps them is plot armor, and boy howdy did it fucking ever.\nI was interviewing to be a stockbroker about 20 years ago. It was a group interview and the dude interviewing us bragged about how much money he made and threw his Mercedes keys on the desk in the conference room.

Worst sound and feeling in the world.\nI've often thought people's attitude after an accident should have a hell of a lot of bearing on their right to drive! I used to ride a motorcycle in Sydney, for over 10 years. I had four or five crashes and my bike was knocked over while parked about the same number of times (no footpath parking so it was really hard to avoid). I reckon in just one case did the driver apologise, and in the majority of cases they expressly denied everything or tried to blame me.\nSo I think the attitude counts for a lot, including in your example. Maybe the old person re-testing needs to take this into account a lot more. My dad got more cautious- not ridiculously so, but much less agressive than the average- which used to cause people to blow their horns and yell and be turds, which as you can imagine really helped him be a better safer driver.\nI mean you can't deny that the game itself is incredibly fun. It's probably the best Mortal Kombat game to date. The only thing that sucked was the grinding; Towers of Time, Krypt, etc. Edit: and the wokeness. \n\nBut the gameplay is fantastic.

Also, I didn't even say it's bad, I just said it's not a good as we all initially thought. \n\n\nIt's not a sense of entitlement either, it's just the simple fact of the matter that, after the gameplay has become stale (which it has), why should I continue playing? Some decent content would help. Another map, more weapons, a new legend, MAYBE even some additional lore would provide some value to the game. It's not entitlement to think that the game should provide more than the bare bones experience that it does. If anything, I simply want the game to be better which is not a bad thing. \n\n\nAdditionally, I did not buy the battle pass because it's inarguably fucking garbage. The game is not fine, it needs help now, or it will die.\nfr we need brogdon so badly\nStrange, I played it about 3 or 4 times. People were super toxic. Uninstalled the game, never played again. It's the only game I've ever quit playing because of toxic players.

I'll never know but it seemed neat.\nFor KO to ruin I'm guessing.\nI agree with the video, I just watched this for the first time this month without any knowledge of watchmen. And the whole film felt like an intro to a story that never really got its tires to the ground. Like ya the whole mars thing was clearly climatic but I didn‚Äôt feel the build and I didn‚Äôt feel the fall either. Was like doing a burnout for a hour and a half, my emotions, my heart rate, all of it was just constant waiting for that something to really hit. And it never does. Although I do enjoy the cinematography of the film it feels like Snyder‚Äôs most spliced up film. Like a comic book I‚Äôm reading but skipping every 3 pages and figuring out the story from that. This movie really lacked depth and I don‚Äôt think Snyder particularly wanted there to be depth.\nEverything on the ground it‚Äôs sucking up I would imagine.\nExample:\n\n&gt;Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night‚Äôs Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.\n\nThat's putting the Wall being built as early as six thousand years ago.\n\nA quote straight from GRRM:\n\n&gt;This one really puts the PRE in prequel, since it is set not ninety years before GAME OF THRONES (like Dunk &amp; Egg), or a few hundred years, **but rather ten thousand years (well, assuming the oral histories of the First Men are accurate, but there are maesters at the Citadel who insist it has only been half that long).**\n\n[http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/06/11/hbo-greenlights-goldman-pilot/](http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/06/11/hbo-greenlights-goldman-pilot/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat would be in line with both the Andal invasion and the rise of Valyria.\nI was just thinking that today too\nyou can probably do most of it with super gonk\nWe also have our own power grid, and are the largest consumers of renewable energy of the states.\n**Trader**|**+Karma**|**Cake Day**|**Submission Karma**\n:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:\nu/Dawgct |**451**|02/07/2019  *‚Äì  2 months ago*|42 + 81\n*^([XB1] IGN: Set your ign here: url://coming.soon!)*|*^(reddit = 451)*|*^(No outside) ^(bids/offers.) ^(Reposts of active) ^(bids/offer) ^(posts are allowed once every 2 hours.

My mom talked to me when I was 13 and told me that if I ever wanted anything like that I could tell her and we could find one for me. I think that it's completely healthy for a kid to want this. Unfortunatly for girls, It is much easier to masturbate as a guy. It would be better to just have these thing accessable to girls and guys\n8dio ‚Äî —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–µ–±–µ —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –≤–æ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ —á—Ç–æ –¥–ª—è –º–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–∞, –¥–∞. –ï—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–∫—É–ø–∞–µ—à—å –±–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∏, —Ç–æ –∫–æ–ø–∏ –Ω–∞ –ë–µ—Ä–ª–∏–Ω—Ü–µ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ –°–ø–∏—Ç—ã, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –±–µ—Ä–µ—à—å —Å–∞–º –∑–Ω–∞–µ—à—å –≥–¥–µ, —Ç–æ –±–µ—Ä–∏, —â—É–ø–∞–π –∏ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–∞–∂–¥–∞–π—Å—è.

More than 15 years later it still upsets me that in someone's time of a most basic need, I did nothing.  I know I could not have given him a drink, but I could have put off my responsibilities for a minute and helped him by swabbing his mouth with a little mouth sponge soaked in cold water.

Then there is a large amount of open ground between the inside of that circle and the Night King in the centre.\n\nIn order to stab the Night King she has to get from the keep to the godswood, and then somehow traverse the ranks of wights which are standing at least 4 or 5 deep (if not more) behind the generals, then nip between the generals and cross the huge portion of open ground (as illustrated by Theon's lengthy charge) to the Night King without being noticed at any point. She has to do all of that at speed which would also make her more noticeable. Further, no matter how silent you are that doesn't stop you being seen unless she can turn invisible (which she can't).\n\nHer stealthiness is also undermined by the fact that she couldn't even get out of a room past 4 or 5 of them a few scenes before without being noticed let alone past a whole watching force of them. Yeah, sure, she was noticed because the White Walkers heard her blood falling from her head to the floor but doesn't that just show how good their senses are that they can hear a drop of blood hitting stone from half a room away? How unlikely it is that somebody could just run through them unnoticed?\n\nIt just really strained my suspension of disbelief for her to just pop-up in a seemingly impossible place at just the right time.

My guess is the dog is testing boundaries and misbehaving with you because you're new and taking away your boyfriend's attention and affection that used to be directed solely at the dog. You can try making friends with the dog, by taking it on walks and playing with it, and by giving it boundaries and discipline. Stop it when it destroys your belongings, and make your boyfriend pay for their replacements. If the dog nips at you, or pulls the blankets off you, or takes your food, correct the behavior. If you're not sure of the best way to do this, consider taking an obedience class with the dog. Training sessions can be a good way to bond and also make sure the dog respects you. If your boyfriend is not supportive of your efforts, or consistently undermines them, its a pretty good sign he's valuing a misbehaving dog over your relationship and it is probably time for you to move on.\nlvl 2 gankers will still gank lvl 2 most of the time, because theyre high risk high reward champs who snowball of the first blood and they will still get one scuttle most of the time\n&gt; Have you considered that you may be doing some passive aggressive bullying?\n\nI get told basically constantly that I am really nice and kind.

He had a GI bleed (intestinal bleed) and a million other problems. One of the biggest protocols for that is we don't give them anything by mouth and only give them IV fluids to try and stop anything from possibly getting to the bleed and making it worse.

They also have had more diversity in terms of teams that made it (10 teams) compared to Portugal's 5 or Netherland's 7. All three countries have 1 trophy and 1 lost final to their name, but France has 6 semi-final appearances, to the Netherland's 2 and Portugal's 1, and 11 QF appearances to Portugal's 9 and Netherland's 2. Add onto that the fact that France has had consistently more success as a footballing country since the 90s (which factors in people's idea of a Big-5) and that their youth system is unrivaled in the world. \n\nBefore you bring up the CL era (since 92-93) argument, the notion of Big-5 is very recent. Despite that, it's obvious that there are more French teams which have had consistent periods of success than Dutch teams. Reims, PSG, Marseille, Monaco, Lyon, Saint√©, Bordeaux have all had stretches of success rarely intersecting with each other. I doubt there are 5 teams in the Eredivisie that have reached 2 or more European finals, and 8 that have reached at least one.\nHoly shit, just a cursory glance at his history... that guy is an asshole.

I can't tell you how many gun-nuts are part of a \"well regulated Militia\". Chances are none of them are.\n\nI'm all for the 2nd Amendment. It was a necessary thing to have when you're literally writing a document that is designed to commit treason against a King. There will be war, perhaps wars in the future, and they wanted to have laws in place to allow normal citizens the opportunity to raise arms should England return, or the sitting government evolve into the same tyranny America revolted against in the first place. The 2nd Amendment wasn't written so everyone can have a play-gun in their house and shoot anyone anytime.\n\nIf they really believed in the 2nd Amendment, then to own a gun you have to be a member of the National Guard, or maybe each State gets to form a State Civilian Militia, which consists of responsible gun owners who are well regulated.\n\nI MEAN IT LITERALLY SAYS WELL REGULATED IN THE WORDS AND THESE FUCKS DON'T EVEN WANT BACKGROUND CHECKS LIKE WTFMATE\n\n\n^^^gotta ^^^calm ^^^down\nThat's what tequila is for\n&gt;I feel like this goes against our entire plan and foundation for our current relationship.\n\nLife is what happens when  you're making other plans. \n\nThings change.

And if something happens to your relationship, it leaves the homemaker partner in the proverbial dust. \n\nI did the stay at home wife thing for a little while after the company I was with went under and before I got a part time gig and went to grad school. It was stressful as hell on me because all the time, in the back of my mind, I had \"what ifs\" cropping up. What if my husband got laid off? What if he got sick? What if he got injured? What if he left? No matter how improbable some things might have been, they still popped up in my head. \n\nIt's possible he's coming from a place like that. \n\nIt's also possible he feels he needs more structure (and maybe external structure) than just being a \"homemaker\" can provide. \n\nAsk him about it. Ask him why he feels he needs to do more. \n\n&gt;I want him to focus on things he loves without trying to monetize it. I want him to make art for himself, because he loves doing it!\n\nTell him that. But also tell him you'll support him if he wants to monetize certain things. An Etsy shop only takes as much time as you want to put into it. You're working on no one's schedule but your own if you're not creating custom designs. \n\nHaving a kind of routine that has an external factor (selling to the public) may be good for him. \n\n&gt; I don't want to lose the idea that i built in my head of what our dynamic will look like.\n\nWell, you may need to be more flexible with what that idea looks like.\nWhat's next, Trump company scrip instead of real money for his workers to spend at the Trump store?

It might seem that way in the past 20 years after Chavez and Maduro's regime, but Venezuelans were very fond of America and their culture. Caracas - Miami was probably the most crowded and important connection we had for decades.

A study showed only 100 companies are responsible for over 70% of pollution iirc. Take an active part in your local community so you can contribute to change larger than yourself if only by a neighborhood. For a family effort consider going out to pick trash, get to know how your food is made and switch to better alternatives if available to you (not saying go vegan or whatever, I'm an avid omnivore, just see if the production of your food can be changed for the better), if buying clothes get durable materials. Natural lasts much longer, opt for wool, cotton, industrial hemp etc instead of ones derived from plastic. Don't shun GMOs, often times they're modified for the benefit of us and the planet. If you use a car but can afford not to and your quality of life isn't terribly reduced please opt for public transport or a bike. If it's not detrimental consider even getting rid of the car, they're a pretty bad investment tbh. That's all the advice I have for now. Of course I'm not telling you to follow all of it but remember that, ultimately, it's big companies donating to campaign funds that are the biggest aggressors and the least we can do is vote for the people with our future's best interest.\nThis just comes off as \"I'm a prude\".

It uses feminist theory, such as \"patriarchy\", that is plainly hostile to men in broad, gendered terms. It subscribes to the typical 100% nurture viewpoint, which gives it free license to ignore men's issues when they want to by claiming it's simply a sociological issue, and that men need to change.\n\nI've also seen multiple posts that seem very concerned with men and boys being able to conform to feminine gender norms, with none about men and boys being able to conform to masculine gender norms. Which, as I've said, I consider to be a big problem in education. This is a very feminist viewpoint. It stands up for the feminine perspective while ignoring the masculine perspective.\n\nThe sub has a clear feminist bias.

I had started puberty when I was 9 so by 10/11 I had sexual desires. Instead of being told that it was okay and educating me, my mother took away my notebooks that detailed out my curiosities and my door was removed from my room for a while.   \nBy age 18 I had racked up a sexual body count in the double digits, been preyed on by many an older man online into masturbating, showing off, and talking dirty with them over texts and on camera. I'm now 24 and have finally started to slow down thanks to my girlfriend who has helped me see that my sexuality is actually okay (I always would say that it was okay to be a slut, okay to be gay, etc., but I never really believed it for myself). By now I've gotten up into the hundreds on the people I've been with, and it's a damned miracle I haven't ended up pregnant, riddled with diseases, or murdered.  \nIf my parents had nurtured that, or even at least \"allowed\" it instead of forcing me to hide it, I would have made much smarter decisions in my life and I probably wouldn't have spent away so much money (mostly on drinking) and time getting laid by one night stand after one night stand. For a while I was that person who was constantly bragging about my sex life to anyone who would listen, because I never got the chance to talk about it *at all* growing up, and so I just *needed* to be heard.  \nIt's important to at least be accepting, rather than condemning, especially at that age. It took me 14 years to talk about sex with my mom, and I was married for a while, wouldn't even talk about it then.   \nLong story short, just accept it. She's going to have desires, and it's better to act on those within your house, in the safety of her bedroom, with plastic and silicone, and the support of her parents. Instead of in public, in the back of some dude's car, or in the grass outside of the church you and your family went to for years.\nre-entering $FB Calls..either May 17 $195 or July 19th $210..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso thinking of hopping into $SQ for earnings - Calls..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRounding out the day..look for a dip on spy..get into it before JPOW sends us to the mooon\nKentucky's teachers are embattled against our god-awful, Trump-lite governor Matt Bevin for what feels like ages now.

You really think that given eight years of show and *twenty-two* years of novels, they couldn't come up with a more compelling motive for the Others/White Walkers than \"look they just want to kill everyone because why not oooooh scary!\"?\n\n&gt; Look, I wanted more too, but after ep 2 was pretty clear they just want to bring the endless night, and that was pretty much foreshadow since ever.\n\nJust because they were established to have a lame motivation one episode prior doesn't make it *not* a lame motivation.\n\n&gt; They are these horror stories from old tales that want nothing more than death, thats it.\n\nWhich is incredibly lame, if that's *all* they are.\n\n&gt; Even in the books the WW are nothing more the silent killing machines.\n\nThe Others have appeared \"on screen\" in the books a grand total of three times so far (two of them in direct sequence), and we've gotten literally not one whisper of their motivations. They're also described as being very, very different and far creepier in my opinion. If the only motivation they get in the *books* ends up being \"because they want to kill stuff\", then I'll honestly be pissed.\n\n&gt; Maybe in the next 2 books GRRM will give it more lore about the first man and the ritual that make them and the magic involved, and maybe they just want to cool down the planet a little bit who knows, and if he ever write the damn battle, Im pretty sure it will take months, a lot of people will heroically die (there is a lot more chars alive in the books anyway) but Im pretty sure that the end will partially be the same.\n\nLiterally nothing about the creation of the White Walkers as it is in the show is in the books. It's possible that it'll end up being the same or similar, but I doubt it. Like I said, the book treatment of the Others is far different from how it is in the show.\n\n&gt; And we have some eps left so maybe bran will do some timey whiney stuff and we may undertand more about what was all that.\n\nYeah, I dunno' about you, but finding out the motivation behind the giant nebulous villain after *they've already been easily defeated* doesn't sound like it will work very well story-wise. It kind of loses its impact at that point.\n\n&gt; Bran still have a plan or he would never be so resolute into tell Jon who he really is. \n\nYou have far more faith in the writers of this show than I do.\n\n&gt; What I dont understand is why a villain like Cersei, a great character with 8 seasons of backstory and way more evil things in her back since freaking ep 1, is dismissed because \"she is not a zombie\" while all people wanted was a freaking blue darth maul that never opened his mouth to be \"THE villain\". I just dont get it.\n\nA whole *hell* of a lot reasons, actually. For one, Cersei is an idiot. She's a good villain, but she's in way over her head, and has been since season 1...until the writers of the show suddenly decided that she was a conniving super genius, right around the time where they started making *actually* intelligent characters like Tyrion and Varys into idiots. And, to be clear, I don't actually mind her getting in some good plots, like with the bombing of the Sept. But being  Super Genius End Boss material is A) not who she is in the books, and B) not even who she is in the earliest seasons of the *show*. She should have been the appetizer conflict in the first half of the season, before the *real* threat of the Walkers was faced.\n\nSecond:\n\n&gt; freaking blue darth maul that never opened his mouth to be \"THE villain\"\n\nYeah, because the Night King (who doesn't exist in the books) is a *poorly written villain with no motive*. That doesn't mean he *should* be, because the Others themselves *are* interesting as they're presented to us in the books and in the early seasons of the show. And both the books and the early seasons of the show *clearly* set up the White Walkers as *the* threat. There are multiple prophecies that either do or probably do relate to their defeat, they're set up as an unknown, enormous, existential threat slowly building throughout the series, and they're the focus of *literally the first scene of both the show and the books*. They are *the* villains. The entire point of the Night's Watch plot-line is that while the realms down south are all falling into petty bullshit and power grabs, they're ignoring the *real* enemy that threatens to wipe out all of humanity. That's the entire point, that's why so much time and focus is devoted to them. And then in the show they're fought in *one* major battle and they lose it because a teenager managers to OHKO their leader out of nowhere? And she's not even one of the *many* potential candidates of the *multiple* prophecies? That's a *ludicrous* waste of the literally years of set-up for the threat they posed.\n\nCersei is an interesting villain, but she is not *the* villain of the series, the Others are. And they got taken out in one episode.\nUsed to live in CT, so whenever I could hit Alchemist I would. Treehouse and Relic are my two other favs.\nHello /u/Guinearito!

It was a shitshow from the get-go.  There was no oversight, the work was pure shit, and in some cases, the infrastructure was in worse shape after the work was done.  This included roads (gravel and slurry sealing, done as badly as you can imagine), electrical (terrible), solar (also terrible), and so forth.  It was outrageously expensive, and at the end of the contract, the company dissolved so there could be no accountability for the garbage-tier work that they had done.  Billions and billions of taxpayer dollars disappeared with nothing to show for it.\n\nMoral of the story: beware any infrastructure project the Democrats agree with.

But my point is that Trump is pushing for this type of move.  He wants to demonstrate who has the power in our government.  It is not the Congress or the Courts.  It is the President.  If Nadler or Congress try to arrest any Trump people, all Trump has to do is put them in an executive branch office or have a FBI security detail protect the person and that will be the end of any attempt to arrest by the Congress.  Even if the Court system tried to enforce, Trump could simply say no way.  Court has no power without the executive branch enforcing its orders.  The reason this has never happened is because everyone that actually knows what is going on realizes that ultimate power of arrest (Executive function) lays with the President.  Congress and Courts do not have this power and never were supposed to have this power.  This power has been taken by Congress and Courts to help create a deep state.  The only group that benefits from power being taken away from the President is the deep state.  Trump is basically declaring war on the deep state and the way they control this country.  Media will never tell you this but this is what is going on right now.   Trump is pushing them to have this fight.\nI was playing around with the audio visualization that got enabled recently.

That having been said, I also don‚Äôt get too angry with the TV show writers about it because:\n\n1) They didn‚Äôt sign up to write George‚Äôs story for him, they signed up to adapt the story he had already come up with, expecting George to keep the books ahead of the show.  That‚Äôs not their fault, and it put them in an almost impossible situation.\n\n2) George can take as long as he wants to let his figurative garden grow, allowing his story to be rich and smart and having everything make a ton of sense, but these guys have a few weeks or a couple of months because they have to be ready for the production to start up each year.\n\n3) They‚Äôre talented writers, but they ain‚Äôt G.R.R.M., even if they both had equal time to write the story (which, they don‚Äôt) so given the circumstances they‚Äôve unexpectedly found themselves thrown into, I have a soft spot for them, even when they frustrate me at times.\n\nIt‚Äôs just unfortunate all around, but at the same time... they‚Äôve still mostly done a hell of a job anyway, warts and all, and the spectacle they‚Äôve given us in the last 4 seasons has helped make up for the writing, IMO.\nMy first snake... he is a corn snake, and I got him in January.

The United States has separation of powers, a military controlled by a civilian government, a Supreme Court, and direct elections. All things the romans didn‚Äôt have. Is today a dangerous time, yes. The Republican Party, despite what you may or may not believe, operates on a wholly different level than the Democratic Party. There is a level of corruption and willingness to cheat because of their dwindling base. I can see republicans dragging their feet on legislation to prevent climate change, raising the taxes on the poor, and raising the national debt but I‚Äôm not afraid of them killing the republic or starting a civil war. I‚Äôm afraid of the people that fervently support the Republican Party from a bad place. Barry goldwater set the poison deep and it‚Äôs been festering since 64 and no Republican President has been willing to do anything to get rid of it. If you go down to the local gun shop and hear the conversations and what they say about the government it‚Äôs nonsensical. Trump and his ilk are a symptom of unchecked nationalism and ignorance that‚Äôs been allowed to grow unfettered since 64 and is now creeping its way into mainstream politics. That gun shop talk is now political talk. I‚Äôm afraid that when republicans in Congress don‚Äôt go far enough that it will cause a split like it did in 2009. And that will lead to violence. Do I believe we‚Äôre heading for a Roman Empire style coup, no. But I do believe there is the potential for violence, death, and continuous obstruction that will delay the necessary reforms to save us from climate change.\n**PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE TAKING ACTION.**\n\nHi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: \n\n* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions.

When I call someone a Nazi, it's usually because they're advocating for a white ethnostate, not because I think they're being big meanies.

Calling someone a Nazi or an incel is. If you called me a socialist, I would agree with you, because I believe in the equitable redistribution of wealth to solve social injustices.

For some context, he's pretty athletic and disciplined in terms of his diet and training. He trains for Ironman triathlons at least once a year and he does half IMs, marathons, and distance cycling events as \"training\" in addition to his coached sessions. I have never been that athletic nor do I plan to be, ever. At the same time, I have never thought I was fat or have an unflattering figure. I'm 5ft6 and fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. Granted, I don't have the same muscle tone or the athletic build as my spouse, but I consider myself somewhat active. I bike to work everyday which is a good 30 min. But I also eat real food, not Goo or protein bars like my spouse. \n\nAnyway, my spouse got into triathlons around the time we were married. Since then, he has been making little suggestions about my body and doing things to suggest I diet. Some examples:\n- you'll look so much better with some definition in your abs\n- aren't you worried about love handles?\n- wearing a \"I'm with fatty ----&gt;\" tshirt when we're on vacation\n- jesus you have no triceps! you should volunteer to be a research subject at the medical school!\n- make me try a vegan diet for a month\n- one weekend when I was away on a work trip he cleaned out all the snacks in the pantry so we can try to live \"snack-free\" for a month\n\nI don't really need to keep going but you get the point. I feel like these comments have been coming at me more frequently. At first it was just like one off-handed comment like once a month. And it just kept getting more frequent and now he's making a fat joke like once or twice a week. We celebrated my belated birthday this past weekend. His gift to me was a couple's membership to Orange Theory (a type of exercise class...our neighborhood just got a new studio). When I saw the gift I teared up a little but not because I was happy. I told him I just felt like he doesn't think my body is attractive enough for him. He got offended that I would take his well-meaning gift as a criticism and is still mad at me. Now I feel really terrible and want to find a way to make it up to him. Did I really act assholish by crying and saying those things?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Listen, I love the books and I love the show they are both good.  Last night's episode was epic.  Their plan didn't work, and the crypt was a terrible idea, but really if it was down to that (raising the dead after the initial battle) then everyone was screwed anyways where else were they going to go?  Seriously suspension of disbelief is a thing you are meant to have to enjoy fiction - even the books require it. Magic, dragons, etc. none of this makes any sense at all.

It is so frustrating.\n\nFor instance, when he says that they lost separately, I wanted to yell ‚ÄúBECAUSE YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE!‚Äù He had the opportunity to call Cap and didn‚Äôt. For years. He also had the opportunity to return to Earth to work together as a team. He chose not to. You can‚Äôt blame Cap for your choices.\n\nFurthermore, what is Cap supposed to do, congratulate Tony for creating a robot that tried to destroy the Earth? It isn‚Äôt that Cap says there is nothing we can do to protect Earth, guess we will just lose, peace! And then he bounces. \n\nI‚Äôm not trying to say that Cap is perfect. He is stubborn and unwilling to budge once he makes a choice - usually without explaining his reasoning. However, he acknowledges when he makes mistakes. He says sorry.

There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. Seek shelter in a sturdy building, or underground if possible. If you are caught by extreme winds or flying debris, park the car as quickly and safely as possible -- out of the traffic lanes. Stay in the car with the seat belt on. Put your head down below the windows; cover your head with your hands and a blanket, coat, or other cushion if possible. If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway,leave your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands. Avoid seeking shelter under bridges, which can create deadly traffic hazards while offering little protection against flying debris.\nhttps://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/safety.html\n\n\n\nAs a last resort, lie flat in a ditch, ravine or below grade culvert to protect yourself from flying debris. If no ditch is available, you may remain in your vehicle, put on\nyour seatbelt, lower yourself below window level, and cover your head with your hands\nor a blanket. \nhttps://www.weather.gov/media/ict/handouts/WeatherSafety.pdf\nNAH, except for me.

All this talk about LA becoming a Clippers city has always been BS.  The Clippers just need to find their own appeal and they can success within the city like many other second teams do.\n\nIf you look at the team's marketing efforts in recent years you can see a pivot away from being an inoffensive team that appealed to nobody by trying to appeal to everyone.\n\nNow the messaging is \"LA our way\", \"blue collar\", etc.  Some of that is tied to the current group of players and some of it is a bit silly (it's a billion dollar organization employing millionaires).  However, what it is an attempt to create an identity that is attractive to LA residents that aren't pulled in by the Hollywood glitz and glamor of the Lakers.\n\nIf you spend enough time living in LA, you will find lots of people that HATE the Lakers, but also have no love for any other team.  That is the group that the Clippers need to target, not current Lakers fans.\n\nTL;DR: it will always be a Lakers-first city, but the Clippers can find their own success by establishing an identity and culture that appeals to selected groups of LA residents.\nLol I get it\nWe have both.

Else you end up like a China or India that just steals all the hard work and pumps out cheap knock offs. \n\nWe probably need some sort of change though that still incentivizes investing into R&amp;D but stops before it becomes exploitive.\nI found one of WWE‚Äôs creative writers!\nIm 30 and enjoy spongebob. Its a nostalgic thing for me as well. My kids dont like it.\nShould this fit in r/happycowgifs ?\nCan we all agree this episode fucked the lore?\nThems fighting words right there. You better be prepared to back up that talk!\nI was thinking Tom waits specifically but yeah\nGot choked twice and raped. He threatened to murder me and my family and himself in a murder suicide fashion.\n\nSplit was nasty and he stole $10,000 worth of belongings from me and won't give it back. It took months of therapy just for me to sleep for more than 4 hours a night due to nightmares. I weighed 99 lbs and was on the verge of being hospitalized for being so underweight.\n\nI live in fear for my life and am barely above homelessness. I have learned my lesson. I'm dating boring, safe guys from here on out. It's better to die bored than to live every single minute of your life looking over your shoulder and being scared half to death and paranoid the other half to death.\n\nLISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU AND SEE RED FLAGS YOU ARE IGNORING.\nWell I guess \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFUK SPONGEBOB\nYour order is weird. It should go lonely, horny, briefly happy for obvious reasons, depressed after realizing what you did, and then falling asleep\nHe knows what happens when, \"people's shit gets emotional\"\n\nDoesn't take a Costco trained lawyer to realize that.\nYeah but it's literally stated in the books and show that Melisandre can't see the future, she can see hazy visions in the fire and has to interpret them. She interprets them wrong pretty often; hence her backing Stannis for the entirety of the series. She just saw eyes being shut forever in Arya's future and then she finally realizes when Beric dies that he had served the Lord of Light's purpose, which had to be protecting Arya. Then she realizes the meaning of what she saw, and puts the emphasis on the blue eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah maybe the directors didn't know at the time that Arya would kill the NK but it makes perfect sense within the story for Melisandre to be able to make that callback so I don't know why people are complaining.\nYTA.\n\nYou're correct about vaccinations and she's wrong, but this isn't the way to make your point.\n\nObviously if you want to make a donation to the charity for its own sake, go ahead, but don't do it as her Mother's Day gift.\nThere are at least 4 separate timeline/universes now as a result of the Time Heist.\n\n-- A universe in which Thanos and his army no longer exist, along with Gamora and Nebula (2014 timeline).\n\n-- A universe in which Loki stole the tesseract after the main Battle of New York. Thanos is still alive in that timeline.\n\n-- A universe in which Capt America was alive and well during the entire 20th century and lived to a ripe old age before disappearing (going back to the current timeline). \n\n-- The 4th universe is our own in which every event covered in the movies happened, but the 50% that were snapped out of existence were brought back 5 years later.\n\nThere are at least those, but potentially many more. Especially since we don't know how Capt America replaced the stones exactly. Could be several just from his little escapade.\n\nOf the 4 universes, I would say the 3rd one might be the most fucked up because no Capt America for any of the \"22 movies\" can't be good. Thanos might win that timeline.\n\nThe warped 2014 Thanos dead timeline would be pretty interesting because Tony's incessant paranoia would never be realized. Hopefully someone would stop by earth and give the good news.\nTBH that would have been more self-aware.\nThe ball just has to make it outside of the box\nI mean, I'd been masturbating for several years at 12 so she might not be \"jumping straight to\" anything.\nNTA\nWether your desicion about your daughter was good or not, your wife should never have acted like this in front of your child because now she wont acknowledge you anymore. \"any problem with dad ? Lets just not listen and lets tell mom.\"\nDon't forget that this is still happening all over the world. Russia, china, even japan is still pretty backwards from what I hear. \nI wish there was more being done to help these people but right now it seems to just be getting worse in some places. *cough cough* russia *cough*\nHold peepee and it goes up, I don't see why it wouldnt work for Facebook\nGreyworm did? When he called for retreat did the Unsullied stand their ground because they don‚Äôt retreat?  Like it‚Äôs just not what they do, mythologically speaking?\nYeah, mom's treatments are insane for IVIG too. She has to be inpatient. For 4 days they do 14 hours of IVIG. Then she stays another 3-4 days in the hospital until she recovers enough to go home.\n\nThen she needs atleast a week of recovery at home. Then she gets ~2 \"good weeks\" and then goes back to treatment and repeat.\nUgh. That means we're two weeks out from unofficial \"gentleman's\" rules where there is no deathmatch, only a lobby for duels where if you try to deathmatch you get banned.\nI think you should be yourself\nDangerous question in these times\nhttps://heavy.com/news/2019/04/trystan-andrew-terrell/\n\nClose... got one important factor wrong\nlol so you can wage intersectional imperialism with no resistance?\nYeah that‚Äôs reasonable, but I also think it would be reasonable to bring a side or dessert lol\nHe's a living weapon created by the Children of the Forest to kill all the humans. That's his motive and his intentions.\n&gt; The world would be better off without you\n\nOh boy...such a level-headed and appropriate comment to someone that didn't like a single scene in a movie.\nThey didn't have much of a support system at all. I'm just saying hopelessness is no good. It seems to me they have us right where they want us.\nYa a lot of providers including HBO had some color banding issues that made if hard to see due to the compression they toss on it. Waiting for that sweet 4k though.\nPut a watermark on this gonna get snatched\nYou should really watch it again.  \n\nShe initiates the divorce after he quit his job (without talking to her), threw an expensive birthday party for their son (after they had agreed to only have a small party because his grades were bad), and brought livestock into their house. This was the final straw in a marriage that he clearly has no respect for.\n\nBecause she has a stable, well paying job, and can afford to pay for the house they live in, she stays in their house with the kids while he moves out. The court decides that shared custody will be based on his ability to get a steady job and a place to live. That's completely reasonable. In those three months, he has unsupervised visitation.  \n\nHe gets a job as a janitor and an apartment. But rather than focus on building a life for his kids and himself, he sabotages his wife's attempt to find someone to help around the house, and then deceives his wife and children in order to exert control over their lives. Including, but not limited to, vandalizing the car of a man that wants to date her, assaulting him, and putting cayenne pepper in his food (knowing he's allergic to it.)  \n\nWhen everything finally comes out, why wouldn't she be freaked out? Living a double life, lying to his family and the court? You say there's no sign of mental issues, but the whole thing could be construed as mental illness.  \n\nAnd in the end, after the judge sets supervised visitation, she goes to the court to request his visitation be unsupervised, and that he takes care of the kids after school.  \n\nIf you think she is one of the great villains in film, you have a warped perspective of the world.\nWhy the FUCK would they make him so humanlike? It would be ok if he had long legs, big hands, and big feet. That's it\nYes. And while I am a big fan of Dany's, I think at this point it would mostly be because of lack of time + writing. With 3 episodes left I just can't see her getting to a point where she's believably so far gone that Jon has no other choice but to kill her. \n\nI mean, Daenerys blatantly saved Jon's life in the last episode by torching the wights, twice if you count Drogon swooping down and knocking The NK off of Viserion as he was aiming to spear down Jon+Rhaegal. I simply don't trust whatsoever that D&amp;D could justify Jon killing her with the time we have left.\nI'm gonna die of confusion now\n\"please interview me. FFS\"\nI will respect any player that doesn't bitch when he gets called for a foul\nI agree halfway. Looking at some of those losses, like the Bengals and Giants, they got all their points in 4th quarter kind of garbage time when defenses are looking to minimize mistakes and be conservative.\nHis age is geologically insignificant.\nSheamus got his ass kicked by another wrestler?\nWhat kind of crappy teacher would care about views, what is the reasoning??\n\nI mean I'll watch, but still..\nTo try and really sell just how dastardly KO is I guess as it was a sped up turn\nNTA. The people who said you were asshole are using the sex card. Yes, everyone masturbates; however, using sex toys at age 12 is wrong. It can make her become dependent on it when she has sex like how people become dependent on night quill to sleep when used for a long time. \n\nDon‚Äôt let your kid but sex toys at age 12. Even some social media don‚Äôt allow users to be under 13. Wait until she is 13 or possibly 14 until you buy her a sex toy.\nPlease provide some of your own writing for analysis\n\nThanks\nIt is fan run, completely open, and they are currently denying all attempts to pay them. It is running issue 25 content.\n**I have no flaws**\n\nHe was right all along lol\nJanny are you ok, are you ok janny?\nAs a gay man and proud I think this is accurate\nWhen were the below pictures taken?\nI know that :p \n\nThen again, everyone‚Äôs got to have a hobby ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nI'm from Brazil and I always get shocked about stuff that's older than my country's first records\nThose are potato croquettes.\nMy point is this movie is marketed towards kids. Do you think they give a shit what Sonic looks like when they never grew up with the character? They're used to different iterations of characters. Just look at Batman, Spider-man etc\nwhen does fox take over\nNTA- she didn't tell you she was getting a referral bonus for you so why would you need to pay it back? More importantly, why would she want to take the chance of having to repay $1,000?\nDid someone convince Vince that every fan lost their memory of the last few weeks? They‚Äôre gonna re-debut Roman on Smackdown like nothing happened at this rate.\nThe missing key: cop was black.\nProbably because it‚Äôs not gonna be written well.\nSame boat.

So many bodies/partial remains that the PRC eventually just used powerwashers to wash partial remains down street drains.\nYee i wasn‚Äôt hard on him about it, but i know he understood the question. I mentioned it to him after class and went through a problem showing that you could literally get a negative answer for volume if you did it with celsius (cuz negative ratio for P1V1T2 = P2V2T1). I usually grasp the concepts really easily because im two grades ahead in math, so the math behind it sunk in a lot already. He said ‚Äòi honestly never thought about that, but my initial hypothesis is that Kelvin starts at absolute zero  while celsius starts up the scale‚Äô or something like that. \n\nDo u enjoy teaching?\nHi how yall doing glad to be here. Take my wife, please.\nEveryone should be dead. It took seconds for the unsullied front line to be overrun. The famous frontline that is said to be able to hold off a Dothraki Horde.\n\nEveryone was in a bad situation, it's the army of the dead, there is no safe place. Not even in the crypts!\nLuckily, Tyrion grabbed that knife. I mean, he could have waited like 30 seconds and the wights would have dropped on their own, so his connection with Sansa was sort of an empty gesture since there weren‚Äôt really any stakes.\n\nMan, that scene is depressing.\nArya was one of the most wanted people on the continent.   Of course things were happening to her then.\nI think your dad already knows. Who knows what kind of arrangement they may have. Or maybe he just doesn‚Äôt care?\nI like you can see the other player feet still with that shitty overlay\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense#Trans_panic\n\njust three notable cases from wikipedia, and keep in mind these are just three where the attacker was found and went to trial. additionally, many trans people report facing violence upon disclosing the fact that they're trans to potential partners. this is one reason trans people tend to prefer meeting people online to in person; online there's no risk of them being assaulted.\nThis makes me want to cry!\nOnline dating. I broke up with my boyfriend of almost three years a few months ago, and despite being heartbroken I still wanted to go out and have fun with someone. After waiting a little while, I installed a dating app-that my best friend had suggested- on my phone and hit it off with a guy fairly quickly. Fast forward maybe an hour, and he's trying to call me sweetheart and has asked me to transfer colleges so that we can go to school together. I very quickly uninstalled that app. Online dating is not for me.\nTo some people it's seen as a freedom of being able to defend themselves or \"even the playing field\" should something like this happen. I know Reddit is typically a very anti-firearm place but to those in the pro-firearm camp situations like these only fuel the argument that \"gun-free\" zones don't work, and that instead of keeping guns off of campus they were only kept out of the hands of people who may have had a chance to defend themselves if they were allowed to carry firearms. \n\nCarrying your argument out by just saying \"fuck 'merica\" doesn't do anything. There's a lot of us that just want to have rational discourse on the subject that you don't agree with, and you aren't helping bring anyone to your side of the argument with that kind of comment.\nYTA\nIt's both your choices.\nYou are the parents.

He doesn't want to part with me, and sometimes the things he does have made me think he loves me even more, but in his own different non-romantic way. I just don't know. I can't read his mind.\n\nWe've talked about it a lot, and he doesn't know if he's aromantic or not because he hasn't had experience in the real world much - and he's never been a fan of romantic things to begin with, nor has he ever even thought anyone was attractive before. Yet, he says his feelings for me are different from how he feels with others - but we don't know if that means he's feeling romantic feelings, or if it's just because he's never had a really close friend before.\n\nThe age gap exists, but it's never been a problem. We often don't even really notice. He acts wiser and more mature than me sometimes, but other times it's vice-versa.

Their enemy has no cavalry or anything that can match their mobility except mounted White Walkers (low numbers and high value targets they'd happily engage with) and the Night King on his dragon, who Jon and Danaerys are hoping to pounce on the moment he reveals himself. The mounted White Walkers are vulnerable and hanging back so you don't want the Dothraki getting back there (every one of those that drops is a chunk of your undead forces falling with them). Are you going to commit to an all out attack with the Dothraki horde trying to flank you? Hell even if they lightly engaged and fled not to be seen again until the majority of the undead host is trying to pile up over the walls of Winterfell they would have had a big impact. But using them as if they were arrows to be launched into the enemy and hoping they take a bunch of things down with them was ludicrous.\nI COMMENTED THIS THREE DAYS AGO\nWhy do you think most other countries care about humans?\n&gt; it‚Äôs almost like you want to hate the episode \n\nYou think?\nI think the Toy Story poster appears ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù because how much recognition they have.

Remember his big infrastructure plan? It was a huge a giveaway to (surprise, surprise) rich real estate investors to build and operate toll roads that are about 80% funded by the taxpayer. Basically the way it works is that private investors can buy into one-sixth of the project. Then they get a huge (82%) tax break on the revenue that the project generates ... but only if the project generates revenue. It's just a tax cut with voodoo economics projecting magical infrastructure gains. It ends with grossly overbuilt infrastructure that is crumbling because we never maintain it. It's a plan to build new, not fix anything. We already have this problem and this would be even worse. We already have vastly more miles of lanes and pipes and bridges per ca-pita than any other country, and it'll bite us in the ass eventually.\n\nOh, wanna guess how this ends?

Sounds like the pilot was coming through some cloud cover and wanted someone to double-check his approach or something. Tower was probably right in that they can't always do all of that, but was an asshole about it.\n\nSecond one: plane was being asked to taxi to a certain runway, but went the wrong way to get there. ATC saw it and thought he was going to the wrong runway, tried to correct him. Pilot was an ass about it. \n\nThird: ATC was giving a pilot approach directions to land (from what angle, heading, and runway). Pilot was not responding back to acknowledge, which they are expected to. ATC was cursing him out but didn't realize his mic was hot. Rest of the pilots and tower controllers in the area were commenting on that. \n\n4th: someone was giving someone else a radio frequency 27.87 but whoever they were telling it to kept hearing the wrong number.\n\n5th: JFK tower confirming where a plane is so he can give them correct taxi instructions to take off. They keep answering the wrong question. \n\n6th: Not entirely sure why, but the plane was coming in for a landing and could not make the requested runway for some reason. They stated they could not and could only make a closer/easier one. they declared an emergency and told the tower to clear the runway because they couldn't land anywhere else. He kept ignoring them and telling them to follow to the runway he gave them instead.\n5 of the top 10 are from the infinity saga\nThat's one of the most beautiful dogs I've seen in my life üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüòç‚ù§Ô∏è\nJust like my dick in 3AM\nbut i‚Äôm trying to figure out if myself is an e boy\nYep Target Corporate also.\nPlease this is proof that revelation is upon us.\nLots of countries squat to poop in a hole in the ground.\nJaylen \"Jaylen Brown\" Brown getting to the line!\nHey, you're pretty good.\nI have some grey hair since I was in my 20s.

I‚Äôm a female in my mid-20s, and from my perspective I think that it‚Äôs inappropriate for a 12 year old to have sex toys ‚Äî regardless of gender. Where I live, sex shops and websites require a person to be 18+ to purchase, which I think is fair. Most of these comments mention the idea that ‚Äúall kids masturbate, who cares, stop being a dick‚Äù and I can understand where they‚Äôre coming from in some ways but I can also understand the viewpoint of this father and if it were my daughter or younger sister/younger self, I would just encourage them to live their childhood and not push them into a sexual lifestyle at such a young age. I think that your wife has good intentions in trying to defend your daughter, but disrespecting you in front of your kid and arguing about it is not the way to go about it. You should‚Äôve insisted on talking to her in private about the situation and being a little more open-minded about her opinion so that she doesn‚Äôt feel gaslighted. \nAs a final note ‚Äî each 12 year old kid matures at their own pace; some being overly childlike and prepubescent while others look/act/feel like a teenager. My main advice is to preserve their childhood while they‚Äôre still children and allow them to grow as they age, still guiding them but being understanding of their changing needs and perceptions.\nYour opinion seems to be that they shouldn't have an opinion on if a woman should have an abortion.

Fuck Boston.\nShe was screaming her head off though\nI honestly just have to assume that none of these people have seen even 2 seconds of news coverage because I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could see the headline ‚Äúcountry goes without power for a week‚Äù and see that as anything less than apocalyptic.\nI see what ya did there\n&gt; What was the point of bringing Jon back, or having Daenerys bring her dragons to Winterfell if they were't going to be used to fight the Night King, especially if fire doesn't harm him?\n\nI understand a lot of the complaints, but I really don't understand this one, and it seems to be incredibly common.\n\nDo you seriously think if Dany wasn't present and Jon never came back things would have been the same? No dragons, dothraki, or unsullied are present. No northern lords rallying around Jon Snow. The Boltons hold Winterfell and they have a very tenuously loyal houses with them. \n\nAnd for some reason you think that the circumstances would have still be the same and that Arya would have gotten a chance to kill him somehow? This just makes zero sense.\n\nPart of the point of the show is that prophecy can't always be trusted. But even if we set that aside, it isn't at all to argue about how that battle would not at all have happened that way without Jon and Dany doing what they had done up to this point. They could still be fulfilling prophecy just by doing what they have done to mount this defense and make it possible that a third party like Arya could get the killing blow.\n\nPeople acting like all that build up with Jon and Dany for no payoff are entirely missing the point. Their victory was the payoff regardless of who made the final blow.\nWe need Snitsky there too so when Heidenreich molests Michael Cole, Snitsky can tell him that it wasn't his fault.\nThey recently (wow, maybe a year ago) came came out with a graphics update and some QOL improvements.

Didnt see this happening before the series\nYeah I get that, I think I should‚Äôve just not said anything about the tinder thing and how I got the email and see how it would‚Äôve played out. It would‚Äôve eaten me up even more than now but I would‚Äôve been able to see if she would tell me.\nShe‚Äôs honestly not a bad person, you‚Äôre right I don‚Äôt know that she will tell the truth, but I don‚Äôt want to be out to look like an ass. I feel like in this situation it is justified for me to ask her to look at her phone, but there‚Äôs also that little angel telling me just trust her and if she does cheat then I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I won‚Äôt be hurt more so because then I know she‚Äôs the bad person in this not me.\nThat link.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nNice job OP\nThey can mix up their spacing and plant there or four species.\nI‚Äôll buy it lol\nI'm going out on a limb that ESH because I have a story to tell.  Actually, two stories.  My daughter had known it was expected that at 12-ish, I have access to that information should I choose to take a look.  Funny thing is, I never used it but came across some issues completely by surprise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was waking up in the morning EXTREMELY tired having gone to bed when she would have gotten 9+ hours of sleep.  I was still getting Verizon paper bills then and saw that she had sent a HUGE number of texts, to the tune of 8700 in the previous month...on a dumb phone with a slider keyboard.  At that point, she was working on the trust of having more freedom and doing well, until I found the obnoxious number of texts going until 3 am.  Her phone was limited to contacts in her phone for texting.  What she had learned, was that if she couldn't text someone, they could text her and she could reply.  I wasn't paying for service that would restrict it that much because..well, she needs to be trusted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat number of texts and her tiredness in the mornings got me looking at that month's texts, which led to finding at least 3 males requesting nudes, which she didn't send (awesome!).  That led to authorities in three states becoming involved and the issue eventually went away.  More of a scare the hell out them likely happened as to my knowledge no charges were filed because she hadn't actually sent any.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other story was her Google+ account.  I used G+ at one point to communicate with a software beta group and one of her posts came up in my feed.  I looked at comments on one picture and found that a guy in town told her she was cute and said they should meet.  It turns out that he was a registered sex offender and worked just a few miles away.  He and I had a discussion and he disappeared from the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth were used as teachable moments because to learn safe behavior and when to spot trouble, but she did have her privileges and access scaled back for a while.  The hammer came down, but not so much on her, as the walking hormones that tried to exploit her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 17, though, unless you've been a colossal screw-up, there should be a healthy amount of freedom but still within reasonable boundaries.\nHave you tried searching with the bandana? I know some chests have the freaking torch invisible for some reason.\nThink of the se√±oritas!\nMy Venezuelan friends say they don‚Äôt want to go to hell because Chavez is there. Fuck your ivory tower understanding of socialism.\nWtf this game started on time\nTerrible power play, has to be said. We did nothing with it.\nLike I said. Peace my friend. We are all Americans.\nI don't know how long it took, because it hasn't been stated so I won't pretend I know. So do you really think they had so much spare time? Seemed to me they were forging weapons until... the day before probably? How long does it take to make hundreds of thousands arrows/arrowheads? You just said it like they'd easly make it, I'd say they had no chance to make them in time based on what we saw.\n\nThem being based on Mongols isn't really an argument here, mongols weren't fighting against army of undead in fictional world with actual magic. From what we've seen, they would get overrun after the first \"round\" at best.\nI'm like 99% sure I know where this is\nIt is, but not the best *one* ever like Cole said lol\nbecome a fire fighter\nHaha and Reid was still alive and our prodigal son to save us from David\nI have zero idea what you're talking about.\nI‚Äôm not ‚Äúupset‚Äù, but I feel the same way. \n\nI like reasonable plot armor, not ‚Äúoh come on that person totally would have been dead‚Äù plot armor.\n\nI‚Äôm glad most of those characters lived, but I would have liked it a little better if they‚Äôve survived a little more reasonable odds.\nI think it's way too much revealing.\nWhat do I get for an occasional headache?\ncreativity.  They lack creativity.  They don't do suspenseful or blast scenes either.  I just kept laughing to myself last episode while yelling \"PLOT ARMOR\" any time it looked like anything bad would happen to our named heroes.\nI'm in for Jon Hamm as Reed ship myself\nOh stop jerking off about that. That's the laziest excuse I've seen yet.\nWhy do you think the show is named \"Empire\" ???\nWas she? She spent at most a few months learning from Syrio. There is no way in that short amount of time would she have a complete mastery of the skill. All the time she spent with TFM most of her training was just cleaning and staff fighting. Yet thats some how supposed to means she magically became the greatest fighter the world has ever seen. Pod spent years being trained by Brienne(who beat the hound who supposedly trained Arya) and to a lesser extent by Bronn. Because of that he is seen is a competent fighter. Not the greatest but respectable. \n\nThat is what makes her a mary sue. Every other character is grounded in reality except her. Oh she spent a few weeks talking to Tywin? Guess that makes her the greatest tactician of all time. Tyrion who spent his entire life around Tywin and still makes mistakes? Heh he can't win all the time. Theon, also a competent fighter, gets stabbed in the gut and almost immediatly dies? Arya gets stabbed in the gut and she naruto runs through an entire city and healed over night from a hot bowl of soup.\nMarried a ‚Äúsocial butterfly‚Äù yes in my case.

In fact, once \"forced\", his healthcare will be regulated, there will be a cost-benefit analysis, and he will be \"forced\" into a home until it is determined his life has no value.\nBobby B, why dont we have a bot for your bro, Stannis?\nMine got sold by my parents they are dicks\nDisagreed completely.

Isnt it?\nYou *can,* but that isn't what is happening here. It doesn't matter what often happens, what matters is what happened here, and it's simply based out of ignorance. There is no attempt to treat her as lesser, nor any intention of treating her differently from how he himself likely grew up.\n\nIn no way is this prejudice, discrimination, or stereotyping. If you think it is, you badly need to look up the definitions of each, and then justify how his actions could remotely qualify as any of the three. Discrimination by definition requires there to be a class that is treated differently/better than her. He's ageist at absolute worst, because that is his **actual** issue. He doesn't think a **12-year-old should be owning a sex toy.** he rules nothing out for the future.\n\nAnd the reason why the semantics matters here is an ignorant asshole is much less of an asshole than a sexist asshole. An ignorant asshole simply needs education or discussion. A sexist asshole is like that at the root of their person and carries negative beliefs about an entire sex.\n\nYou're more than welcome to prove where he holds any perceivable negative view of women or his daughter. Otherwise your argument carries zero validity. \n\nAnd you're also holding him to a standard you won't hold his wife to. His wife completely undermined his authority in front of their daughter and basically taught her to pout (both had their arms crossed) in response to things they don't like. She showed a complete and total lack of respect for her partner and they could likely have come to a reasonable solution if she had done what you're suggesting instead of immediately going on the offensive.\nHe already has pierced Cersei without consent at least once.\nI liked the dialogue style.

The reason they don‚Äôt allow trans people in the military is because technically trans people have gender dysphoria. The U.S. military is not going to accept anyone who will require ongoing treatments like the hormones most trans people get put on. Like I said, trans people should be treated fairly and equally and should have every right every other person does. When it comes to enlisting in the military, not one person has the ‚Äúright‚Äù to be accepted as a result many people are rejected.\nYou know, this thread is just making me anxious and sad. I'm not a medical worker or any worker at all really. Just some kid who needs to get something off his chest in a thread where the mood and topic fit motor less enough. One of my best friends, we've known each other for almost 12 years now, almost our entire lives has had cancer since he was little. I'm not sure when exactly it started but I feel like it was pretty much at birth. When I met him he'd already fought cancer once, if not more. It's been to long to remember clearly. I've gone through a lot of cancers with him, I think it's been 7 by now (including the ones I didn't witness). As much as I hate to say it, nature pretty much fucked him up bad. I wish I could at least say I was there for him all the time but honestly... I'm not so sure about that. We went to different \"grade schools\", were in different classes for most of our continuing education and just got back together around 2 years ago, almost 3. We never really separated, we just drifted apart a little. Or a lot. Who am I to judge. We didn't do a lot together, didn't know each other anymore etc. He missed school a lot anyway, surgery and illness kept him at home where he was forced to be alone all day, maybe accompanied by his family and some friends if his health allowed. His cancer came back (again) some time between 2017 and 2018 I think. I'm not sure anymore which year it was, I've been adrift in my own darkness for a while. Which ever one it was, 17 seems more likely, was our year. We did so much together over the summer, going to lakes and beaches around the area. Having parties and barbecues. You know the deal. Then it got worse, and by worse I mean a lot worse. He had surgery last year. He was bad before, then he had a little high and plummeted right back down there into an even deeper hole he couldn't control or escape, yet anyway. He's been stuck at home since summer last year slowly getting worse. There's not really anything that anyone can do as it seems. He's getting more and more paralysed. Less and less motivated. And the only thing that could make him a little better is slowly drifting away. His friends. It's so hard to stay close when you're unable to see each other because he can't come to school. Additionally it's hard to visit him because it's pretty much a gamble if he's in a position where that's possible. And it makes me feel horrible. I feel like I abandoned him. Sadly I've got some shit of my own so it's not like I can just flip that coin every day, hoping he's able to do something. I hate how harsh that sounds, I'm just bad at words. My biggest fear is that I might not be there for him in the moment he needs me the most. And even worse, I'm not sure how I would react to his possible death of that is what it's going to end up being. Will I be sad? Will I be able to be sad? I don't want to lose him. But maybe I already did.\nThat's weird. Why are you plugging Bernie, in a post about Bernie attacking fellow democrats.\n\nYou know that looks bad. Right?\nRight before the big battle when Spiderman came in I felt like a surge of emotion and I was so happy bc he‚Äôs such a pure neighborhood Spiderman and didn‚Äôt deserve to be dusted\nOh no.

It‚Äôs not like dicks are attractive. Nor do they tell you you‚Äôre pretty so attention seeking? Not really. He said she‚Äôs passive and gets this a lot so from a girls perspective who has friends who don‚Äôt know how to speak up , I can absolutely see this being true. Everything he‚Äôs saying correlates to that as well. He‚Äôs a douche and she needs to learn to put a stop to it as a married woman but she‚Äôs not cheating. But if you head over onto r/niceguys you‚Äôll see what happens a lot of times a woman tells a dude to stop sending unsolicited texts and pics. Which should make one understand why a woman may have a hard time saying stop and just finds it easier to ignore.\nits not about \"will we make or lose money\" its about how much money they make lmao the whole point of the company is to make money and if a lux skin makes more than a zilean skin then they will make the lux skin\nExcept of course, NC passed a law that guns on campuses are perfectly legal.

No, and that's the problem this his mindset and apparently those supporting him. \n\nYou can't possibly believe just because someone is angry it justifies any degree of violence.

I'm pretty sure nothing will happen but I don't know though there have been other developers who have banned players for purposefully using exploits.\n‚ÄúDany while playing her part is only concerned about the throne‚Äù\n\nThis is literally just false. Are we not going to act like she did not bring the dragons, the damn army, and all of the dragon-glass herself? On top of that, she saved Jon twice this episode after he told her that her claim to the throne was ultimately a lie. \n\nWhile I agree Jon united everyone and played a big role, they‚Äôd all be dead without Dany\n\"How wude.\" - the funniest character in Star Wars\nIf all you care about is Dany then you‚Äôre going to make everything about her. But it doesn‚Äôt mean it should be that way for everyone else. I‚Äôm simply rejecting the idea that it‚Äôs somehow shameful to be in the crypts when you don‚Äôt have magic, dragons or combat experience.\nNo they aren't.

It tells her that her stepmother doesn't view her as her child, which she absolutely should regardless of whether her biological mother is still alive. Your youngest was only about 12 when you married your spouse. She knew you came with two children and should have accepted the responsibility of occasionally having to be a parental figure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would try to explain concerns about the message this sends your daughter to your spouse, in a non-confrontational way. If she still resists including her stepchild, you definitely need to do something to prioritize your daughter and ensure she doesn't feel unwanted or second-class as a child without her mother on Mother's Day.\nDidn't the Waif have green eyes?\nThat‚Äôs cute you think that.

The entire series is about Jon Snow.  The Starks are House Skywalker, Jon is Luke, everything happening around them serves only to set up their next (mis)adventure. \n   \n\nSo there. Two major characters WILL die, one additional major character MIGHT die, plus two major supporting characters will absolutely be killed over the next 3 episodes along with tens of thousands of  extras (soldiers) implied as battle deaths in fights yet to come. \n  \nI don‚Äôt know what more you want.\nYeah. That's kind of the point. People have put so much onto the Azor Ahai prophecy but I think the point they're trying to make is that prophecies are bullshit. How many people have there been convincing Azor Ahai theories for? Any one of them could fit. Even in this video, a lot of what they chose might not have been intentional foreshadowing. But what matters is that it can be used to justify the choice after the fact. Prophecies don't matter until after they've already been fulfilled. Then you can find whatever evidence there was for what actually happened.\n\nWhen Bran asks about changing the past, the 3ER says, \"the past is already written; the ink is dry,\"  but really, the whole story is still being written. Nothing is decided for certain until the telling is done.\nNot really. This was two years ago and I summarized what happened. It was at night and a man took my bluetooth doorbell camera (I think it was by Nest) and I remember an alert on my phone and watched the clip up until I could figure out where it was and retrieved it. I then called the cops and it was pretty clear who it was and what naughty things he did.\nDisgusting.

So the best thing to do is not to argue about those topics. If your parents bring religion up, just say you have decided not to argue about it any more, and if they try to force an argument on you, leave the room.\nJust here smoking these meats.\nI just want to say bless you and all ICU nurses/nurses. \n\nMy mom had a really great group of people who cared for her. She was in a coma for a month. I was only 18 and I could tell looking back now it bothered a lot of them. We went back to visit and a lot of them cried. They all signed cards and sent it to us. Many said they got really attached to my mom while they cared for her.\nI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case when you‚Äôre doing what OPs doing. \n\nI play the five ai matches a day where you set your defending squad and get my rewards but even that isn‚Äôt good, like I see what they were going for with it like a kind of a mobile game mode but they missed the mark.\nI wanted to see the politics behind the battle plan.

This is HUGE. Can you imagine what Barr and Trump must be like right now? They must be horrified. Mueller just told Barr plain and square he lied to the American people and mischaracterized the Mueller report and the criminal conclusions Trump committed.\nThe name, of course, dedicated to Bob Ross.\nSome of the smarter ones are just disappointed and will get over it.

I‚Äôm saying in a situation where we would literally have to force people to risk there lives for the sake of our countries maybe we should do what‚Äôs easiest for us. Men and nearly always bigger and stronger. The average height of a woman in Canada is 5‚Äô3 while the average height for a man is 5‚Äô10. Woman can do very good in the military but it it harder for most women. Many things are built with men‚Äôs body‚Äôs in mind. Men hold a majority of there strength in there super body compared to woman. I‚Äôm also not saying woman shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be in the army. We would need more people in the workforce and looking after there own families and children without families. Woman are typically better with kids. One task isn‚Äôt more important then the other so why wouldn‚Äôt we in a time of crisis sort people as easy as possible.\nholy jesus......super sexy af\nBecause that skill fits into her abilities, she is a fighter. Therefore it's plausible to the viewers. Whereas if you just throw two characters together that have never been shown to even interact, it's going to throw doubt on their relationship. Now if it were two NEW characters it's easy to just assume they were already friends. But, two established characters? You would have to show SOMETHING at some point pointing to them having met before....a convo between other characters...SOMETHING before they could expect viewers to believe they are friends.

If they ask they ask, and let OP raise his kids however he wants. I don't see you in the household. All he asked was \"Am i the asshole?\" And no, raising kids is a sensitive issue as well. So factor that in as well\nMy kids would find me in a minute. And they‚Äôd be scarred for life, because I‚Äôm naked on the toilet right now.\nThe wrestling business and lockerrooms will always circle the wagons and keep things tight-lipped to \"protect the business\", even if it is for someone who supposedly has heat. \n\nThey are carnies. And they'll always try and find a way to handle things in-house.  So, when a wrestler says \"Ha! LOL Dirtsheets! Don't believe them!\" they're often times just trying to throw people off the scent. And a lot of sycophantic fans will believe the wrestlers on their word.\nNTA. I‚Äôd actually make the same decision, but instead bc I have anxiety and yelling will trigger a panic attack, and in my experience with living with gamers they tend to have very loud, very scary outbursts üò¨ You do you man, make the decision that‚Äôs best for you!\nLet‚Äôs say making your bed is also a part of your morning routine. If you don‚Äôt make your bed does that mean you‚Äôre going to be in your ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to me in the morning‚Äù moods??\nAnd they can raise every single one of yours they kill. Relentless\nBig cunts require big dicks\nIf this leak proves true then those ppl who dismissed are looking pretty solid right now with their guesses in light of ep3! Fun to look back on old comment threads like these i.e. edd jorah theon and beric, you almost listed them exactly! Lol\nSkyrim is probably the closest we‚Äôre gonna get for a while üò≠üò≠\nNo, it happens every now and then\nBack at ya, friend!\nI was alive, but I don't have the slightest memory of 9/11 other than stories I have heard.\nDo you not have dickheads in your country?\nHow does your sister feel?\nTrying to put myself into their mindset, no hind site.\n\nIn all of the encounters the various characters had they never saw the undead foot soldiers use ranged weapons.  With that in mind you can assume only the generals will have ranged weapons and those are ice spears (that do fly far).  Not enough to be concerned about in an attrition war, just keep your two dragons safe.  \n\nThe undead army has a dragon and maybe some giants, that is it for seige weapons.  Considering this is a siege situation and the defenders have two dragons this makes for a huge advantage.  Against a human army of this composition, Winterfell could not fall.  They could starve to death, though, so you would need to attack.\n\nA Unique problem about fighting the white walkers is your own dead troops can be used against you.  Everyone knows this and everyone knows they are already outnumbered.  Normally I'd try and bottleneck an enemy like that but the numbers of undead they were expecting means you would run out of arrows.  Plus the defenders had a very powerful calvary advantage.\n\nMassed infantry is a terrible target for calvary, calvary wants thin lines they can just plow through.  (Normally they would also harrass archers or support and run down fleeing enemies but the undead don't have any of that).  So you want to the enemy to stretch out to allow calvary to plow through.  Worse case scenario the lines are still too thick, in that case the calvary can just roam the backlines doing hit and runs.  Either way you don't send such a powerful unit in to die in the opening charge.  You especially don't do it when you can't even see the enemy line.\n\nThere was no good reason for the living to instigate the fight in the dark.  When they charged they clearly didn't know what the enemy line even looked like.  If they had to fight at night the trebuchets should have been used to light the forest on fire, that way at least the silhouette would be visible.  They shouldnhave also fired those things until the undead overran them.  Could even use them to draw out the initial undead charge.\n\nThe trench was a good idea.  We will assume they didn't have time to dig multiple and that is why they only had one ring worth.  We will also assume they didn't have enough time to make a wider or deeper trench.\n\nThey should of had tar/oil to dump over the walls.  We will just assume they couldn't get any for some reason.\n\nDragonglass shrapnel bombs would have been smart but again we can just assume they didn't have the time to do that.\n\nUnsullied on the walls with dragonglass tipped spears would have been great.  First row thrusts downward, that is a lot of reach to help stop climbers.  Second tow is there to stab any climbers that make it past the others.  Northern fighters with swords on the stairs or court to stop anything that gets past the Unsullied.\n\nIt looked like they did a good job with inner defensive barricades in the court.  It was just everything outside of the castle that they fucked away.\n\nI'm not even factoring in the two dragons considering the plan was to hold them back until the NK showed up.  Those two could have absolutely wrecked the undead when they got tied up at the trench.\nBecause I‚Äôm in my school‚Äôs honors math and science program so she wants to ‚Äúshow us off‚Äù I guess\nAww...what breed is that?

She was angry that I had left her and angry that I was letting her die and scared of 'them'. I just hugged her and promised I'd take her to the doctor in the morning, but she died that night.

The participants would have no awareness of which group they were in.  After collecting data you would analyze it and look for the impact of the administration of vaccines, and learn that they represent a statistically significant improvement in human health.  And then some fucktard who slept through the lecture about the difference between 0 and 90 would stand up and say, \"I kinda feel like vaccines cause autism.\"  Which one do you think is actually accurate, the one dealing with reality, or the one who considers feelings to be scientifically valid?\nNot against the bucks lol\nThe amount of meta posts and subs that are all meta posts sort of showed up in the past 2 or 3 years and have gotten pretty bad in the past year.

We were friends that hung out and had enjoyed each other's company.

In playoffs he was obviously amazing. Either way, I just don't like people acting like Clid was some S+++ god in LPL when in reality Karsa/Ning at minimum were considered clearly better.\nI occasionally work with a few guys like this, one we call 300 ( because he must be 300 years old to have done everything he says he did ) and the other Bigger and Better ( because everything you have done, he‚Äôs done it too, but better and crazier )\nYou suck way more than this guy\nAnd then you see all the normie watchers insulting the book readers (and others more interested) for being fan boys etc\nI'll just use our inevitable matchup in the next round to make the trip back out there. If you order them online, you don't get the German movie quotes in the bathroom\nThe point is that to many Americans one of the \"problems\" with antifa seems to be that they are against facism.

Overall things are pretty swell, how are you?\n&gt;If you want to know you can in about half a second but it's one of the first times I haven't seen a load of headlines like \"The face of evil\" and long descriptions of how bad ass and terrifying he was.\n\nlargely because it didn't happen in America so American media didn't have the same access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand the point still remains, they gave him airtime.  we all know who he was.  we only need to see it for a short while for it to matter.\nwell, he's not wrong. this is \"relationship\\_advice\" not \"let me whine and support me no matter what.\" that's called \"your own facebook page.\"\nIs it inappropriate for a 12 year old to look at porn, or jerk off to a catalogue like many kids did before the internet?\nI think it's probably a bridge too far to say they supported AIQ.

Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen will be fun and win games in the short term.

But that doesn't magically transform the situation into an \"unsolvable one\". The situation is still solvable regardless of the odds. In regards to a deus ex machina, the situation is supposed to not have any foreseeable solutions to the problem.\n\nVery confused by your second point. They knew Arya was killing the Night King in season 7, Bran giving her the dagger was absolutely foreshadowing.\n\n&gt;At that precise moment, for the viewers knew, Arya was the only person whose fighting style could make use of it. Bran had not even voiced his plan of baiting the Night King into facing him yet\n\nThat doesn't make it not foreshadowing? This doesn't disprove anything.\n\n&gt;The White Walker that dueled Jon was surprised because it did not expect Jon to have a weapon immune to destruction\n\nI know that's like exactly what I said haha.\n\n&gt;Jon would have been dead if not for plot armor, given how the White Walker spends a great deal of time throwing him around instead of impaling him as it did with the Thenn.\n\nOr you know how I just explained in my post, White Walkers have always been cocky and their hubris was their biggest weakness. They intentionally take their time and don't try very hard because they usually don't have to.\n\n&gt;None of this indicate that humans can physically compete with White Walkers, only that Valyrian Steel won the day.\n\nExcept for the fact that they still had a sword fight and Jon kicked their ass (as I mentioned in the post). \n\n&gt;If White Walkers could actually feel hubris, then the Night King would have tried to kill Jon in single combat.\n\nHubris doesn't equal stupid necessarily. The Night King is cocky but he isn't just going to stupidly risk his life with a guy who he knows has taken down a White Walker.\nIs this some garbage instagram post?

I let her out, let her back in, feed her, and giver her some good girl pats. I've done this for around 4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter taking care of my neighbors dog for around 4 years, I've started learning her habits and other things. She is a lot like most dogs, but recently I noticed several things. I have a routine I do to let her know I'm about to leave, since she seemingly loves out time together. I pat her head three times, and wave goodbye three times (A little OCD I know, but it works). Recently she started putting the top of her head against a wall or chair or couch when I'm near her. It took me awhile to figure it out, but I realized the reason she does this is because she knows that I can't leave until I pat her head, so she sees this as a way of keeping me by her. 12/10, love her to bits.\nMiddleton clueless on defense\ngot it, hoppin to ya\nThanks!

Just because he's not doing behind the back passes or threading the needle doesn't mean he sucks at passing. If you actually watch the game you would see that whenever Kawhi gets doubled, he will make the correct pass to either the open man or someone who can swing it to the open man. Before game 2 he was top 10 in FGM, 2PM, 3PM and FTM per game. Not only that but he was also top 10 in FG%, 2P%, 3P% and FT%. He was the only one to do that. He literally dominated every aspect of the offense while also being one of the most efficient.

You should really encourage your kid to use a proper toy.\n It depends on exactly what they are doing. Everyone can be an asshole or snap. It's literally a problem with everyone, and I completely understand it.\n\n While I'm not an asshole myself? I'm more quiet and distant when I don't have caffeine. People who know me tend to pick up on that, because I am normally happy-go-lucky, and automatically assume I'm being a dick. I've legit had 30 people say that, including exes, because they expect me to be smiling and energetic all the time. Or talkative. \n\n I worked as a \"Barista\" for years. Remember caffeine is a drug that you do withdrawal from, and that is understandable while someone isn't the same. I've seen people who are the nicest perk up when they drink it five minute later.\n\n So I don't usually take it personal. After working in the service industry my whole life I've learned it's normal. Even the nicest people become assholes and snap a bit. Not to mention the shit they are going through. \n\n The key thing I look out for in someone snapping is an apology later. We are all human, and different. We all have our bad days, and I super appreciate it when someone apologizes about their behavior the next time I've seen them. You'd be surprised on how many apologies I've had weeks or months later. The way I see it is that people reflect and understood they took shit out on someone innocent.\nSadly, it rather is.

Mom is from an ONS, no further romantic interests pursued, but I do want to be part of the kids life in a big way. She does not want to do joint custody though. I don't tell a lot of people that I'm going to be a dad because it requires a lot of explaining about who the mom is, and ultimately I don't even have custody so I'm not even sure how big my role can be. It's not an active secret either though.\n\nI recently met a girl (1-2 weeks ago). We've been talking A LOT every day about everything besides me becoming a dad. The conversation has minimal flirting, although there has been some romantic interest. I don't know what she wants from me and she's doing that thing where she says \"Idk, I'll see how things roll\", \"I just like getting to know people.\" This continued even when we met up for dinner, which makes it feel a bit friend-zoney. \n\nI am planning to tell her about it tomorrow, but I want to mentally prepare for the backlash.

It is the act that attracts copycats. Not the name. We are FAR beyond stopping the crazies in society from planning mass casualty events. Hiding a shooter's name just gives people a false sense of justice. They feel that it denies the shooter something when the fact is that the shooter still successfully killed people.

See: the Civil War. How do you envision people in \"all\" areas rising up when most people can't even be bothered to show up to protest for things they believe in or even fucking vote? You really think a plurality in the MILLIONS would risk life and limb and put their family's safety at risk? Right. That leaves you with a few pockets of armed resistors could easily be dispatched considering the military isn't having to strike overseas, they're running domestic sorties.

It's always been this way since we got him his first toothbrush.  He just does not like having the toothbrush in his mouth.  I have tried the Elmo brushing teeth song, as well as others but he will never let me brush his molars.  I got fed up tonight and searched for cavity cartoons on YouTube and watched the first video.  It was quite insightful, but as a 2.5-year-old learning that green germs live on the tooth completely traumatized him.  He now has a worried look on his face and no amount of encouragement is changing him.  Hopefully, his happy personality doesn't change because of this one video.

We may not be able to control the X axis of time, but we CAN control the state of matter to a degree more than other beings on the Y and the Z axis, and also where we end up on the actual location of the physical plane axis.. so you can't move backward, but you are aware of your forward movement and can move in every other axis that matters. \n\nI'd say that qualifies more than any other creature im aware of.\nPfffft!

It encourages healthy sexual exploration and safe sex habits. You overstepped, and should take a step back to listen to your wife and daughter.\nI kindof see your point. Guys usually try to pay, which is kind of nice, but I think her being the one to ask for the dinner date makes her pretty presumptuous. Though they typically try to pay, I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs their duty, especially these days. I feel like it‚Äôs only fair that if women want equal rights they should expect equal responsibility. I‚Äôm also in the position of having more disposable income than most of the men I‚Äôve dated. That being said, I had to force my current SO to let me even pay for a round of drinks on our first date so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.\nNever understand when a \"fighting champion\" books themself for the PPV.

Maybe Sharon's grandparents were in the UK still and Peggy became a sort of surrogate Grandma, hence \"Aunt Peggy\". Maybe she grew up hearing her Mom &amp; Dad call her \"Aunt Peggy\" and just followed suit without anyone correcting her.\n\nPeople also frequently call close family friends of their parents \"Aunt\" &amp; \"Uncle\" if they're around enough. Some sub-cultures in the US use \"Auntie\" and \"Uncle\" as terms of endearment for respected elders (even if there's no actual relation to them).\nI have been like this since around 8 years old. I have worked (off and on) nights since I was 20.  Ugh next week I start a new job, and have to do a week of day shift. I am completely dreading it.\nIn order to call something \"grey,\" you first have to identify what is \"black\" and what is \"white.\" If you can identify what is \"black\" and what is \"white,\" then how can you call something \"grey?\" the whole notion is absurd.\n\nAnd just because I disagree with you, prove you wrong, and stay on topic does not mean I am a kid. Telling me to grow up proves you have no legitimate argument to defend yourself, therefore you become hostile. I'm not really big on name-calling, but you kind've seem like a closet-fascist to me.\nShooting is obviously not a reasonable response.\n\nBeing a sixth grader can be miserably hard. Personally, I find adult life much, much easier than my childhood. My father is an abusive alcoholic, and my home life was awful and unstable. My school life wasn't much better.\n\nI'm not saying that this is excusable in any way. What I mean, is that this is a symptom of a problem we need to get to the root of. Troubled and at risk kids need help and compassion before it gets so extreme, but often find adults and even their peers to be dismissive and condescending.\nHah i just watched that episode!\nDiana easily IMO. her power curve and playstyle are completely warped based on how fed she is.  \n\nher scalings are so unbelievably nutty due to the compensation given for the thrashing her base damages have gotten over the years that she itemizes into spellbinder + deathcap then proceeds to point and click any squishy to instantly delete them.  doesn‚Äôt even need the land a skillful reset, just presses spellbinder + R + W + Q midair and you disappear\nThe night king should have cut Arya in half, only for her to remove Brans face mask and stab the NK.\nI second this.

In fact that hand on her shoulder is present in every cell. Clearly shopped but still, a HOOT.\nBuying porn for a minor is illegal.  Providing sex toys could be considered corruption of a minor.  I'm not sure the legality of it, but I think it's very creepy to support buying sex toys for minors.\n\nBeing odd doesn't matter, being illegal should be the bigger concern\nShaun the Sheep posters were 2015 movie poster parodies if I recall correctly, I remember one had Shaun holding a razor like Bond did in SPECTRE's poster\nI have read and understood that explanation of the Cap situation, but in TAO's illustration:\n\n1.There is one line\n2.stone is taken\n3.there are two lines\n4.stone is replaced\n5.there is one line\n\nRegardless of how it really works (I'm fine with the alt universe cap created by marring Peggy), the demonstration shows that replacing the stones merges the timelines back together, such that any alternate timelines don't exist. \n\nAt least from TAO's perspective, there wasn't a time when the Time stone wasn't in her immediate vicinity, at least if Cap brought it back the same moment Banner left, and that should be true of every stone.\nGonna riiiiiiiiiide till I can't no more\nLet‚Äôs give up our guns, and trust the police to protect us!\n\nAlso, let‚Äôs hire police based on their minority status!\nHearthstone\n\nSo many of the options here are simple little time fill games but hearthstone is a game you can play for hours and hours for free. People will say you have to pay to ‚Äúwin‚Äù but that‚Äôs only if you want to fast-track to having a deck that can get you to high rank on their ladder system. There‚Äôs hundreds of hours of other game modes which have nothing to do with what cards you have or the ladder system. \n\nI started playing just after release and I 100% regret not getting into steaming the game as I play 3-4 hours each day just by myself for myself.\nIts 10am, I havent slept yet\nThat has nothing to do with this post?\n\nThis post has nothing to do with Arya killing NK, it is about Theon defending Bran...\nI believe Kofi, he would've accepted Owens' challenge for the title if Owens asked.\n\nHe wanted the match with Rollins the night after Raw for both titles.\nThe South: So our plan will succeed, excellent.\nJust wait until he fights Meownos\n&gt; If intentionally breaking the rules to gain an advantage is not cheating in your mind... what exactly is?\n\nTo gain an unfair advantage. \n\nEvery player gets the option to break the rules, it comes down to how the rules get enforced. What separate Harden is he is the best in the NBA at hiding calls. A guy like Chris Paul has fouled like crazy on defence (even with the Clippers) it doesn‚Äôt mean he was cheating, it means he is good at hiding calls.\nI say to myself this feelings uncomfortable but it's not dangerous it will pass.\nYou look like you would be in some Ursula and Ariel Hentai\nBucks seriously made no adjustments\nIsn‚Äôt he her uncle tho?

The worst are all the people I see in the giants sub who hide their flairs here so they don‚Äôt get shat on.\nYTA, because of the way you reacted if nothing else. Adolescents masturbate: it‚Äôs *normal*. Of course, it‚Äôs completely your prerogative as to whether you think she should have a sex toy, but the truth of the matter is that you‚Äôve handled the situation in one of the worst possible ways.\n\nDon‚Äôt think she should have a vibrator? Okay, fine. Sit her down and explain why. Do not punish her for being curious, or for having sexual desires. It‚Äôs likely that all you‚Äôve accomplished by doing that is make her ashamed of what are completely natural desires.\n\nThe truth is that she‚Äôs still going to masturbate. She‚Äôs still gonna experiment, and she‚Äôs still gonna question things, and if she really wants some sort of toy, she‚Äôll find a way to get one. Kids are intelligent, aware creatures and when they‚Äôre punished for things like this, they don‚Äôt stop doing them‚Äîthey just learn to hide them better.\nOr hang out besides/behind him like Rubio.\nOr... an increasing number of dumbasses are firing their guns at people in a fit of rage without any real plan.\nI'm gonna need a PTSD diagnosis after reading that so I can bring my Chihuahua on airplanes.\nThat would have been okay.\nRVD haven't crush Triple H's larynx yet.\nSame way mom doesn‚Äôt have to consult dad when showing her daughter how tampons work or when talking to her about long-term birth control plants (like going on the pill). \n\nI‚Äôm usually for straight up equality, but this isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs equal - man and women have fundamentally different  plumbing down there. A woman who has lived with a vagina, clitorous, uterus, etc her whole like is absolutely more qualified to advise a daughter than a man who grew up his whole life with a penis. Dad‚Äôs often learn for the first time that girls have to wipe front to back when they have daughters - most women don‚Äôt know how to gently stretch and clean an intact baby foreskin until they have sons without a circumcised penis. Puberty is tough enough without someone shaming you; it gets a lot easier if you have a nearby, non-judge mental resource for information and advice. If I were a parent, I wouldn‚Äôt want my kids consulting only with the internet and hiding their questions from me, because they might be getting shitty info. I don‚Äôt mean I would direct them to specific porn sites, I mean I would teach them how to discern between harmful and medically, ethically informed sites.\nBud fr needs to realize horfords an above average player\nThe exact same IG took his time poring over how the Hillary email investigation was handled and his report, after a big buildup, was a big nothing.\n\nI‚Äôll believe that this time he is referring people for actual indictments when I see it.\nThe only one I genuinely don't like is the lux one, even then the splash art still looks amazing\nSaid person ‚ÄúHello‚Äù\n\nYourself ‚ÄúGood morning Amber Rose‚Äù\nWhat's the easiest way to tell if someone is a Dota player?

I think the Night King May have died with more left unexplained than Snoke, if that‚Äôs possible. But maybe we‚Äôll get some Bran-exposition on the Night King in the next episode(s)?\n\nTo me, it‚Äôs not so much that she killed him that‚Äôs the real head scratcher, but that he died without ever explaining or saying anything. We were set up and told that he was a person, then he survived the fire, so maybe he was a Targaryen, and he seemed to even smile when the fire didn‚Äôt work on him, which suggests some level of emotion and feeling, and he has left symbols in the past to send messages, suggesting a level of critical thinking and awareness, and we were set up for a meeting with Bran, but then he‚Äôs just offed without even saying a word.\n\nAnd why did he take his sweet time not killing Arya when he caught her? If he was a person with feelings and motives, I get the delay and the taunting, savoring it, but considering he got absolutely zero dialogue or anything, he seems more like just a force of nature than a living human being, which would make him slowing down and delaying an easy kill a really out of character move for a force of nature. He could have killed her in an instant; he‚Äôs pretty much superhuman.\n\nTL;DR: we seemed set up to see the NK fleshed out with some motivation and personality, but he didn‚Äôt get it, which makes his smiling when hit with fire and his not killing Arya right away when he caught her inconsistent with his seeming to be merely a force of nature. Is he only ‚Äúhuman‚Äù when it allows him to slip up or look cool?\nYou're looking like a dipshit from the sideline\nOr, a necessary sacrifice to get so the pieces in position for Arya to do the dirty.\n\nThat said I'm squarely in the camp of \"what the narrative fuck did I just watch\"\nHold on are you from Nebraska\nyou do realise that many, MANY male circumcisions end up with either the baby dying or sever complications right?\n10 minutes for the segment to actually get anywhere...\n\nCome on Smackdown, you're so much better than this\nThey don‚Äôt care about competitive too much they don‚Äôt want it to be competitive\nTrump's America, where white men feel empowered to commit acts of terrorism while their phony president cheers them on on social media.\nTossing your money at cashiers\nYou're still missing a comma!\nUnless Jon is suddenly revealed to have a uterus I assume it will be Dany since they hinted the shit out of it last season.

Do this as a quick opening and move on.\nAs a nursing student, my preceptor and I were assigned a 78 year old woman admitted for not having a bowel movement for 14 DAYS and for abdominal pain. She had gotten a CT scan a day prior to the day we took care of her showing that there wasn‚Äôt any bowel obstruction or any other bowel issues we needed to worry about. The doctors decide to put her on all kinds of bowel prep, laxatives, and stool softeners as a preventative measure. They just wanted her to poop before they could discharge her.\nAround halfway through the shift, I am doing my hourly rounding on our patients and I see that she is shaking, drenched with sweat, and barely conscious (she was sitting up talking on the phone the hour before). I run to tell my preceptor and she says it‚Äôs probably just because she really needs to poop, and that she was gonna get an order for an enema. I insist on getting her something for pain. Luckily we are able to get her some morphine and the preceptor also got the enema. As she‚Äôs positioning her to give her the enema my eyes went wide and I said firmly ‚ÄúSTOP.‚Äù The preceptor followed my eyes to the PROLAPSED UTERUS hanging out of the patient‚Äôs vagina. Long story short, we call an OB and the OB puts the uterus back where it belongs so we assume we resolved the issue. An hour after resolving the prolapse, the patient starts having pain again. \nShe kept saying ‚ÄúNo, please don‚Äôt leave me. I‚Äôm going to die in this hospital. I‚Äôm not going home. Please, please stay with me. I don‚Äôt wanna die alone. I don‚Äôt wanna die alone!‚Äù It broke my heart. \nI sat with her for 2 hours until my shift ended. We talked about her pet chihuahua, her two kids and her many grandkids. She told me how independent she was, and how she didn‚Äôt wanna bother her kids. The last thing she said to me was ‚ÄúThank you for not leaving me alone. I will miss you.‚Äù She looked so calm, almost serene. She was smiling warmly at me. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and I said, ‚ÄúIt was my pleasure, I‚Äôll miss you too. I hope you start feeling better soon!‚Äù \nI came back 2 weeks later to find out she died not long after I left. It turns out she had 3 bowel obstructions (that the CT didn‚Äôt catch until after) and one of them ruptured. She never made it to the OR. I‚Äôll never forget that sinking feeling when I found out. She was alone...I‚Äôd like I at least helped alleviate that feeling, but she still died alone and that‚Äôs what gets me.\nWe've listened to your feedback and have decided to nerf Kollector.\nBut all the other pictures of diving boards are white so it‚Äôs kind of out of place\nThat's an unfortunate truth today.
